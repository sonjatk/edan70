    "text": "As shown in Fig. 4a , most clusters were enriched in the biological processes of energy metabolism, the cell cycle, translation, and RNA-related functions. Both cluster A (Fig. 4b ) and cluster B (Fig. 4c ) are highlighted. Sixty-nine proteins in cluster A were up-regulated during the whole infection period, especially at 48 hpi and 60 hpi. The DAVID analysis indicated that the proteins in cluster A were mainly associated with cellular apoptosis, including HMOX1, TOP2A, HSPA9, HSPD1, F2, HBB, SLC25A24, BAK1, VDAC2, PHB, APOH, and VIMP. Moreover, five of these proteins were classified as negative regulators of apoptosis.",
