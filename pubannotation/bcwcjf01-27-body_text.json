    "text": "No amino acid changes were unique to the 2003 samples as compared to the 2009/10 outbreak samples from the Eureka area and further south ( Table 2) ; however distinctive nucleotide changes were present in the noncoding and coding regions. Temporal and genetic data indicate that the outbreak began in south Humboldt Co. and spread north to Arcata and three amino acid changes characterized samples from Arcata area and further north ( Table 2) . Whether or not these genetic changes contributed to the explosive increase in fox rabies that occurred primarily in Arcata during 2009 would require further study (Fig. 2) .",
