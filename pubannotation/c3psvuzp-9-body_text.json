    "text": "positive selection analyses to identify an important antiviral domain in PARP13, we investigated whether any of the other 16 human PARP genes also show signatures of recurrent positive selection. We searched publicly available primate genome sequences and identified orthologs of all 17 human PARP family members from a minimum of four hominoids, two Old World monkeys and one New World monkey. We performed a series of maximum likelihood analyses to detect recurrent positive selection for each PARP gene alignment. These analyses determine whether a model allowing positive selection at a subset of amino acid residues is a statistically better fit to the sequence data than a model that does not allow for positive selection. Using PAML software [40] , we found that five PARP genes showed highly statistically significant (p-values ,0.0001) signatures of positive selection ( Figure 1B ). In addition to confirming our earlier findings on PARP13, we found that PARP4 (also known as vPARP) and the three macrodomain-containing PARP genes (PARP9/BAL1, PARP14/BAL2 and PARP15/BAL3) all show signatures of positive selection. We followed up our PAML analyses with the more conservative PARRIS software implemented in the HyPhy package [41] , which takes into account recombination and variation in synonymous substitution rates across codons. Using PARRIS, we again found these five PARP genes to be clearly distinct from the remaining 12 as judged by likelihood ratio tests (LRT) allowing or disallowing positive selection ( Figure 1B) . While our limited screen of seven orthologs in PARRIS only gave a statistically significant p-value (,0.01) for PARP4 and PARP13, analysis of additional sequences of PARP9, PARP14 and PARP15 met statistical significance (see below). Finally, we performed branch-site analyses [42] to look for episodic signatures of positive selection on all 17 primate PARPs. We found that only PARP4, PARP9 and PARP13 demonstrated statistically significant signatures of episodic positive selection ( Figure S1 ). This initial screen might underestimate the total number of PARP genes evolving under positive selection, firstly because our search is restricted to the primate lineage (selection might have operated only in other mammalian lineages) and secondly because we use only seven orthologs. Although such small alignments may lack power to detect weak selection, previous simulation studies have shown that strong selection on a subset of residues can be detected using 1 PARPs are categorized as either poly-ADP-ribosyltransferases (Poly-), mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (Mono-) or inactive based on presence of conserved motifs and, when available, data using enzymatic assays [4, 6] . 2 PARP9 and PARP13 lack one or more catalytic residues conserved in all other PARPs and are therefore predicted to lack catalytic activity, although it is unknown whether they still bind ADP-ribose or ADP-ribosylated proteins [4] . (B) Results of maximum likelihood tests for positive selection. The five PARP genes showing strong signatures of positive selection are shown in red. Shown at left are values derived from PAML indicating twice the log difference between an evolutionary model that allows positive selection (M8) versus a model that disallows position selection (M8a). P-values indicate whether the model that allows positive selection better fits the data. PARRIS-derived LRT (likelihood ratio test) values also report the difference between the log-likelihood values for a model allowing positive selection versus a model that does not. Using seven orthologs in PARRIS only gave a statistically significant p-value (,0.01) for PARP4 and PARP13, however analysis of additional sequences of PARP9, 14 and 15 found that these genes also met statistical significance (see Results). Additional analyses are reported in Figure S1 . doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004403.g001 PAML even with rather limited species surveys [43] . Given the signatures of positive selection we observed for PARP4, 9, 14 and 15 in this initial screen, we characterized these four genes in further detail, collecting additional orthologous sequences to examine which domains contain positively selected residues in order to create a model for how viral conflict may have driven their evolution.",
