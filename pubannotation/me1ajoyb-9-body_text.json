    "text": "Most serological assays for detecting antibody responses in hantavirus reservoirs use virus neutralization, ELISA or strip immunoblotting [12, 29, [41] [42] [43] . While some of these assays are IgG-specific, others use antiserum to whole IgG, including the light chains. Since light chains are shared by all immunoglobulins, these detection antibodies are not IgG-specific. Moreover, no assays are in place for detecting IgA, which should be prominent in mucosal infections. IgM assays have been problematic despite the availability of anti-IgM capture antisera that are cross-reactive with IgM from at least one hantavirus reservoir species [44] . Some immunoglobulins have isotypes with specific effector activities, such as complement fixation or antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. Laboratory house mice have four IgG isotypes; IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3. It is likely that reservoirs also have immunoglobulin isotypes with distinct effector functions and which might predominate during hantavirus infections. These reagent deficiencies are a current obstacle for assessing antibody responses in rodent reservoir hosts. Despite these limitations, many field studies have been conducted examining antibody responses in natural and semi-natural hantavirus infections of rodent reservoirs [34, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] .",
