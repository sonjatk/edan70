    "text": "The most obvious place to test how reassortment might affect the mutation accumulation curve is with the 2009-2010 \"swine flu\" outbreak samples. Despite the fact that the viral line has been attributed to reassortment with swine viruses, with partial contribution from earlier reassortments between swine and avian strains [8] , it does not display a jump in mutation count. Reassortment can produce novel antigenic variants, but it does not reverse the majority of mutations, for they have accumulated in the non-reassorted areas of the genome.",
