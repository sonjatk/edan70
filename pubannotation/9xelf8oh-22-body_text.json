    "text": "The linear range of the assays between the C p value and the log of the target DNA for qPCRs was similar across all assays (Online Resource S9, Fig. S9 .1), containing between 10 2 and 10 10 copies of the target gene. The consistent, reliable limits of detection for the qPCR assays in both red and grey squirrels were estimated to be about 12 (PGK) or 6 (SQPV and SADV) copies per reaction.",
