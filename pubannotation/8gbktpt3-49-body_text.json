    "text": "The duration of faecal shedding of FPV, which is relevant to infection control, has been inadequately studied. This study demonstrates that virus can be shed in faeces for an extended period of up to 14 weeks from diagnosis. Faecal shedding of vaccine virus was detected by qPCR post vaccination for the duration of one four-week study [23] . Shedding of field CPV strains in dogs has been detected by qPCR for 45-50 days [44, 45] , while CPV vaccine virus was shed for 19-22 days on average [31, 46] . Further studies are warranted in cats to further define the duration of faecal shedding of both field and vaccine strains of FPV detectable by qPCR.",
