    "text": "Several characteristics that are reported in human ASD brains were also observed in the present model, including neuronal loss in the amygdala and cerebral cortex 61 , and astrocytic activation in the white matter 62 . We and others have also previously demonstrated microglial activation, enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, including IL-6, and elevated oxidative damage in fetal brains 12, [63] [64] [65] . In the MIA model, microglia play a major role, along with astrocytes, in synaptic pruning and neural circuit formation 2 . In addition, a single injection of IL-6 is known to lead to the same behavioral abnormalities as those observed in the LPS models 66 (IL-6 is thought to be a key cytokine in the link between MIA and the behavioral deficits in the offspring 38 ). In our previous report, maternal H 2 administration reduced both the excessive microglial activation and the increased IL-6 levels in the MIA fetal brains 12 , which could ameliorate the behavioral deficits later in life. Previous studies in adult rodents reported that H 2 treatment could mitigate the behavioral dysfunctions, including short-term memory deficits, cognitive impairments, and depressive-like behaviors, by regulating inflammation and ROS production 67, 68 , which is in line with our current results. Moreover, the present study demonstrated that prenatal H 2 administration restored the MIA-induced neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss, and suppressed the excessive activation of astrocytes at postnatal 5 weeks. It was also shown that H 2 directly attenuated the LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, in primary cultured astrocytes. These cytokines are known to induce apoptosis in oligodendrocytes and hypomyelination in the neonatal rodent 69 . Thus, the suppressive effect of H 2 on both microglial and astrocytic activation would protect neurons and oligodendrocytes against LPS exposure.",
