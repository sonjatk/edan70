    "text": "Greater than 90% of North American rabies cases occur in wildlife [7, 9] , and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) serve as the most frequent source of terrestrial rabies cases in California [10] . Rabies in striped skunks was first documented in California in 1899 and skunk rabies has been considered enzootic since the 1950s [11] . The Northern Pacific coast region (which includes Humboldt Co.) is unusual in that this is the only region of CA where large numbers of gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) are known to be infected with the skunk rabies variant [11] .",
