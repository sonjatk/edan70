    "text": "Although viperin has been demonstrated to be antiviral active against many different viruses in vitro, few studies have investigated viperin's role in vivo. In TBFV infection, viperin was shown to control LGTV dissemination and replication in the brain after intraperitoneal administration, and viperin promoted survival after intracranial infection [141] . Interestingly, viperin has been shown to be expressed in the brain at the basal state [128] , with high basal expression in primary astrocytes [100, 141] . Viperin's role within the brain during neurotropic LGTV infection was further mapped to certain brain regions, as viperin inhibited viral replication in the olfactory bulb and cerebrum, but not in the cerebellum or brainstem. This correlates very well with TBEV infection since viperin strongly inhibited TBEV replication in primary neurons and astrocytes from the cerebrum, but not in granular cell neurons isolated from the cerebellum. Interestingly, cortical neurons were completely dependent on viperin for IFN-mediated inhibition of TBEV, whereas in astrocytes, in which the IFN-mediated antiviral activities are strongly dependent on viperin, other ISGs could partly compensate for loss of viperin [141] .",
