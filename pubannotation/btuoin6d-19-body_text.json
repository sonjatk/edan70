    "text": "The physician suspected the patient of having atypical pathogens when they had persistent or deteriorating symptoms or signs despite treatment with appropriate empirical antibiotics for 2-3 days. Thus, we compared the clinicolaboratory findings between Adv and Non-Adv group patients who were unresponsive to the initial antibiotics treatment ( Table 4 ). The number of patients who did not a response to initial antibiotics treatment was 47 and 50 in the Adv and Non-Adv groups, respectively. The percentage of patients having leukocytosis and monocytopenia was higher in the Adv patients, although there was no significant difference in white blood cell and platelet counts between the two groups. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, which were a showed a significant difference in all study patients, showed no difference in patients with unresponsiveness to initial antibiotics treatment (P = 0.720, P = 0.733, respectively). A greater number of Adv group patients exhibited no response to antipyretic treatment compared with the Non-Adv group patients (25.5% vs. 10.0%, P = 0.045) as well as the number of patients to reach over 40°C and 39 to 40°C (P = 0.003). In addition, the Adv group patients had a higher mean temperature at admission than the Non-Adv group patients (37.8 ± 0.3 vs. 37.3 ± 0.2, P = 0.005). Table 5 compares the clinicolaboratory variables between the combined Adv (cAdv), Non-Adv, and only Adv identified pathogen (OAIP) group patients. Compared to the cAdv and Non-Adv patients, more patients in the OAIP group exhibited the following characteristics: were currently smoking; had leukopenia, lymphopenia, monocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia; exhibited a longer duration of fever after symptom onset; had a higher maximal temperature at admission (over 40°C and 39-40°C); and exhibited no response to antipyretics at admission.",
