    "text": "â€¢ The paper refers throughout to \"optimization\". I think a mathematician might object to the use of the term because the method doesn't actually use a formal optimization process. I don't think this is too much of a problem but I do think a clear statement of what the authors mean by optimization would be helpful (e.g. in the Methods). As I understand it, the \"optimal\" ventilation rate is just taken to be the one for which the health burden is smallest.",
