    "text": "In order to demonstrate that flavonoid-based natural compounds extracted from P. tomentosa act as inhibitors of Cp-NanI, a comparative activity screen was performed. This method relies on substrate hydrolysis, leading to an increase in fluorescence that can be read out in real time. Interestingly, a geranyl (3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dienyl) group at the C6 position within the flavonoid was found to be crucial for both inhibi-tory potency and kinetic mechanism. For example, diplacone showed a 150-fold higher efficacy (IC 50 = 0.11 mM) than eriodictyol, a parent flavonoid lacking a geranyl group (IC 50 = 16.4 mM) ( Table 2) . As shown in Fig. 1 , diplacone showed competitive kinetics, with a K i value of 0.04 mM. Diplacone also acted as a time-dependent inhibitor.",
