    "text": "Model structures of human sialidases (Neu1, Neu3 and Neu4) were built using the MODELLER 9v7 software (Sali & Blundell, 1993) . Human Neu1-4 protein sequences were retrieved from NCBI database (Neu1, NM_000434.2; Neu2, NM_005383.2; Neu3, NM_006656.5; Neu4, NM_001167599.1). On the basis of the Neu2 sequence and structure (PDB entry 1vcu; Chavas et al., 2005) , multiple sequence alignment and structure-based alignment were performed using ClustalX2 (Larkin et al., 2007) and MODELLER 9v7 align2d (Sali & Blundell, 1993 ; Supplementary Fig. S1 1 ) . Regions from Neu1, Neu3 and Neu4 that are not conserved in the Neu2 catalytic domain (Neu1 residues 1-64, Neu3 residues 1-11, 287-300 and 315-326 and Neu4 residues 1-10, 284-336 and 355-373) were excluded. Modelling was carried out for the human Neu1, Neu3 and Neu4 catalytic domains against the chosen Neu2 template (PDB entry 1vcu) using MODELLER 9v7 modelsingle (Sali & Blundell, 1993; Supplementary Fig. S2 ). Each of ten outputs of the modelled structures was ranked using an internal scoring function in MODELLER 9v7. The reliability of the homology modelling was assessed by calculating the root-mean-square deviation (r.m.s. is the intensity of reflection hkl, P hkl is the sum over all reflections and P i is the sum over i measurements of reflection hkl. ‡ R work = P hkl jF obs j À jF calc j = P hkl jF obs j|; R free is the R value calculated for 5% of the data set that was not included in the refinement.
