    "text": "The pulmonary myocardium gene network and coexpressed genes are associated with cardiac phenotypes overlapping those of the stressed heart A limitation to single trait/transcript analysis is that it does not allow for combinatorial interactions with additional genetic loci, because each trait is individually regressed against every marker, i.e., only one locus is considered per trait (Michaelson et al. 2009 ). Therefore, all n 24 pulmonary myocardium gene network transcripts were merged into a single trait using PCA. A network of 100 probes that correlated (r . 0.553, P , 2.40e 205 ) with the synthetic PCA trait was identified.",
