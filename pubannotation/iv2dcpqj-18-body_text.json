    "text": "The domain I of eEF1A was shown to be critical for the NS5A-eEF1A interaction, implying that it may be a potential target of anti-CSFV strategies. We also showed that eEF1A was able to bind to the IRES located in the 5 1 -UTR and inhibit its activity. In addition, we investigated the effects of eEF1A on the inhibition of the IRES activity by NS5A; however, we demonstrated that eEF1A did not antagonize the inhibition of the IRES activity by NS5A, indicating that NS5A and eEF1A perhaps bind to distinct parts of the IRES.",
