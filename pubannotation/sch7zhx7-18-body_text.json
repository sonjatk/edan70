    "text": "Viruses 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 15 determined intermittently ( Figure 1A ) and at passage five, the passaged virus was exposed to increasing doses of DFMO, from 10 µM to 5 mM, and titers measured by plaque assay after 24 h of infection. We observed that virus that had been passaged but not exposed to DFMO remained susceptible, with significant decreases in viral titer observed at DFMO concentrations above 100 µM and an IC50 value of 70.9 µM. In contrast, virus passaged in DFMO exhibited significant resistance to DFMO treatment, with an IC50 value of 293 µM, suggesting developing resistance to DFMO. Following passage of virus, RNA was extracted, purified, reverse transcribed and Sanger sequenced. When the sequenced virus was aligned with the parental CVB3 genome, mutations in the two viral proteases, 2A (Q29K) and 3C (Q52R), were observed. Interestingly, these mutations were observed independently in three distinct viral lineages. Further, the 2A 29K and 3C 52R mutations were not observed in the same lineage. Importantly, no mutations were observed in viruses passaged without treatment.",
