    "text": "Following the recent work of Hajiaghayi et al. [58] , we use a two sided permutation test to assess the statistical significance of the observed performance differences between two methods. The test proceeds as follows, given a data set and two structure prediction procedures, A and B. First, we calculate the difference mean(f A ) âˆ’ mean(f B ) in means http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/147 between sets of F-measure values obtained by A and B. Then we combine the two sets f A and f B and record the difference in sample means for 10 4 randomly chosen ways of choosing two sets with the same size as |f A | and |f B | from the combined set. The p-value is the proportion of the sampled permutations where the absolute difference was greater than or equal to that of absolute difference of the means of sets f A and f B . Then, if the p-value of this test is less than the 5% significance level, we reject the null hypothesis that methods A and B have equal accuracy and thus accept the alternative hypothesis that the difference in accuracy of method A and B is significant. Otherwise, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. All calculations are performed using the \"perm\" package of the R statistics software environment.",
