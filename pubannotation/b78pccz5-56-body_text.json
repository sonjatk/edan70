    "text": "Three alternative exposure control scenarios were evaluated using the mass-balance enhanced burden of disease model to evaluate their efficiency to reduce BoD. The exposure control scenarios start from optimizing the ventilation rates only. As it proves inefficient, it is complemented firstly with control of filtration of outdoor pollutants and secondly with control of indoor sources.",
