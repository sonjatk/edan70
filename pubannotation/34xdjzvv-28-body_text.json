    "text": "Tissues from specific organs were collected in tubes containing 0.5 mL of TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and ceramic beads (Bertin Technologies, Montigny le Bretonneux, France) followed by homogenization using Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin Technologies, Montigny le Bretonneux, France). RNAs were then extracted using TRIZOL reagent following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The purity of the isolated RNAs was examined using a spectrophotometer with an A260/A280 absorbance ratio. The cDNA synthesis was performed using a Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche, IN, USA) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. One microgram of RNA was mixed with 60 mM of random hexamer primers and denatured at 65uC for 10 min before adding 16 transcriptor reverse transcriptase reaction buffer, 2 0U of RNase inhibitor, 1 mM of deoxynucleotide mix, Figure 9 . N3 downregulated TNF-a and IL-1b in CNS and muscle tissues of 5746-infected hSCARB2-transgenic mice. RNA was extracted from the brain, spinal cord, and muscles of 5746-infected 7-day old hSCARB2-transgenic mice treated with N3 or isotype antibody, and antibody-untreated mice as described in Fig. 4 and were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR specific to (A) TNF-a and (B) IL-1b. The relative expression of target gene normalized with the internal control of b-actin expression from the same tissue was calculated as described in Fig. 7 . Unpaired student t test with Welch correction was used for statistical analysis. (*p, = 0.05, **p, = 0.01). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0069858.g009 and 1 0U of reverse transcriptase at 55uC for 30 min followed by 85uC for 5 min. The resulting cDNAs were then subjected to quantitative real-time PCR analysis with EV71 VP1 specific primers. Mouse actin genes in the samples were used as the internal control. To evaluate the expression of cytokine and chemokine genes of different tissues, specified primer pairs were used for the detection of CXCL10, CCL3, IL-6, TNF-a, INF-a, IFN-b, and IL-1b. The sequences of primer pairs specific to the target genes were the same as previously noted in [11] . To determine the expression of IFN-c, Taqman assay was performed using specific primers 59-TCAAAAGAGTTCCT-TATGTGCCTA-39 (Forward) and 59-TACGAGGACGGA-GAGCTGTT-39 (Reverse) and the probe No.69 from Universal Probe Library (Cat. No. 04688686001, Roche). Maxima probe/ ROX qPCR Master Mix (2X) (Cat. No. K02331, Thermo Scientific) was used following the program and procedures provided by the manufacturer. All primer sets were synthesized commercially by Mission Biotech, Taiwan. The optical density reading of N3 against na√Øve EV71 genotypes showed high affinity on E59 which was used to raise the antibody. The affinities of N3 on EV71 5746 and CVA16 were reduced. However mouse anti-CVA16 antisera showed similar affinity on detection of these virions. Isotype antibody was also included as background control. (TIF) Figure S4 Protein analysis profiles of N3 and mouse anti-CVA16 on different EV71 genotypes and CVA16. Purified and concentrated EV71 and CVA16 were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane for Western blotting with N3 (A), mouse anti-CVA16 antisera (B) or isotype antibody (C). (A) N3 detected VP1 proteins at approximately 35 kDa from both genotypes of EV71 [17, 37] and the VP0 of CVA16 at approximately 50 kDa [39] . (B) anti-CVA16 antisera detected similar capsid protein patterns among both EV71 and CVA16 isolates with highlighted VP3 at approximately 26 kDa. (C) Isotype antibody did not detect any protein from both EV71 genotypes and CVA16. (TIF)",
