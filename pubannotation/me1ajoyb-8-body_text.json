    "text": "The principal target cells of infection in rodents (and humans) are the microvasculature endothelial cells of many tissues [39] . Experimental intramuscular infection of deer mice with SNV resulted in detectable virus in the lungs as few as two days later [13] . Many organs appeared infected, although infection was limited to the vasculature within those tissues. Two infectious outcomes occur in experimentally infected deer mice; a disseminated infection of three or more organs, or a restricted infection of the lungs and heart [40] . The relevance of these two patterns to transmission efficiency is unknown. The levels of viral RNA vary dramatically in infected deer mice, with most having modest to moderate levels of RNA at the peak of infection. However, some deer mice have significantly greater amounts of viral RNA, suggesting these deer mice may produce substantially more virus than others, and it is possible they transmit virus more efficiently (e.g., \"supershedders\") [13] . This also occurs in semi-natural transmission experiments [9] and suggests certain individuals may have a prominent role in population-level transmission of hantaviruses.",
