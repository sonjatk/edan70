    "text": "The pathways were enriched and ranked according to their p-values by the Metacore TM database (Supplementary Table S4 ). These pathways are involved in processes of cell cycle regulation, cytoskeleton remodelling, cell apoptosis and survival, oxidative phosphorylation, and immune response. Notably, eight DEPs were enriched in the pathway involved in the \"CFTR folding and maturation\" with a p-value of 9.398E-06 ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The detailed analysis depicted in Fig. 6 indicates that eight DEPs were directly or indirectly associated with the CFTR (Derlin 1, AMFR, HSP70, HSP90, Hdi-2, UBE1, BAG-2, and SAE1). Among them, Derlin 1 and AMFR were up-regulated during infection, which can directly degrade the abnormal CFTR 35,36 . iTRAQ-MS data were verified by western blotting. The verification of DEPs by western blotting was limited by the availability of antibodies to Felis catus proteins. Initial tests selected a set of proteins that were significantly changed during infection and also reliably cross-reacted with antibodies to the corresponding human protein. As shown in Fig. 7 , the western blots confirmed the differential expression of ribosomal protein S4X (RPS4X), 60S ribosomal protein L7 (RPL7), guanine nucleotide-binding protein-like 3-like protein (GNL3L), laminin subunit gamma-1 (LAMC1), histone H3.1 (H3.1), 60S ribosomal protein L17 (RPL17), and 60S ribosomal protein L10 (RPL10 or QM) detected by iTRAQ.
