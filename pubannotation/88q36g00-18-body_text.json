    "text": "In conclusion, we have provided evidence that maternal H 2 administration reduced deficits in short-term memory and social interaction in the LPS-induced MIA model, and also demonstrated an attenuation of the LPS-induced neuronal and oligodendrocytic cell loss. Remarkably, the neuroprotective effect of H 2 appeared in the amygdala and cortex in this mouse model. The neuroprotection is thought to be due to the suppression of neuroinflammation, including excessive activation of microglia and astrocytes and the increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as reported previously 12 . Although further investigation is required, our current and previous results point to the potential efficacy of maternal H 2 administration on the long-term neurological outcomes of offspring exposed to inflammation in utero.",
