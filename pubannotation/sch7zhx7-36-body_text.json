    "text": "Polyamines play several roles in the eukaryotic cell and likely affect virus replication at several stages. By isolating DFMO escape mutants, we can glean insight into the mechanisms by which polyamines function in virus infection. Here, we have isolated two protease mutants following passage of CVB3 in DFMO. We previously characterized escape mutants for chikungunya virus and found three mutations that conferred resistance when simultaneously present in the virus [31] . In contrast, we find that CVB3 gains resistance to DFMO with a single mutation in either protease. From our data, we cannot determine whether polyamines facilitate protease activity against a specific target; however, we observe that both viral proteases maintain activity in polyamine-depleted cells with either of these mutations and that these mutations facilitate virus infection in an otherwise antiviral environment. Determining the specificity of this activity is an area of important future investigation.",
