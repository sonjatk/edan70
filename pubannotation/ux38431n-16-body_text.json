    "text": "In total, 76 (13.8%) of 552 SARI patients were positive for HAdV. The prevalence of HAdV among inpatient children with SARI in Northern China was 20.1% (n = 52), which is higher than that in Eastern China (8.2%, n = 24) (P < 0.0001). Most of the HAdV infections occurred in children aged 6 months to 2 years ( Table 2 ). The seasonal distribution indicated that most of the HAdV-B infections occurred during the winter and spring (Table 3 ). However, no season variation was shown for HAdV-C infections in this study.",
