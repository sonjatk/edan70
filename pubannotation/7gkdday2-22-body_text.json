    "text": "Next, the study focused on the detection of viral pathogens (Tables 3 and 4 ). RT-qPCR method was adopted to detect a panel of 10 different respiratory viruses. About 79% (158/200) of enrolled ARI patients were laboratory-confirmed for viral infections with either single viral infections (54.5%; n = 109) or infections with more than one viruses (24.5%; n = 49). Although the number of viral infected patients was 158, the total number of virus detected in this study Modified disc diffusion method was used for profiling of antimicrobial susceptibility/resistance. Bacterial strains were identified as either sensitive or resistant to an antibiotic based on the diameter of the inhibition zone interpretative, as manifested by CLSI.",
