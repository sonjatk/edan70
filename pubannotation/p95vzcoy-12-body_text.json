    "text": "For the quantification of viral titers a pooled sample of five workers per sampling week was crushed in 100 µL TN buffer (100 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, pH 7.6) with a 5-mm metal bead in 2-mL Eppendorf ® (Basel, Switzerland) tubes using a Retsch ® (Haan, Germany) MM 300 mixer mill for 1 min at the frequency 25 1/s [57] . Injected honeybee pupae extracted as well as positive controls using 200 µL TN buffer. Fifty microliters of the homogenate was transferred to 1.5-mL Eppendorf ® tubes and the RNA extraction was done using a NucleoSpin ® RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Oensingen, Switzerland) following the manufacturer's recommendations. In the final step, RNA was eluted in 30 µL of elution buffer and stored at −80 • C [57] . To monitor the efficiency of the RNA purification and cDNA synthesis, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV, 1 µL TMV solution (1:1000)) was used as an exogenous internal reference added to each sample at the first step of the RNA extraction [58] .",
