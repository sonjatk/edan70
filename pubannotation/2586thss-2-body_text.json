    "text": "HCV is a common cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide (2) (3) (4) . Currently, there are two main methods for detecting an HCV infection: one detects viral RNA by RT-PCR (5) (6) (7) (8) and the other detects HCV antibodies by immunoassay [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)] in serum (9, 10) . The sensitive ELISA assay uses recombinant viral proteins corresponding to multiple polypeptides from different viral regions, including structural proteins and non-structural polypeptides (11) (12) (13) . It can be used as a confirmation test. However, its usage is limited in the clinical setting as the procedure requires sophisticated laboratory equipment and there is a high probability of contamination. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to develop an affordable and reliable rapid lateral flow test to detect the presence of HCV antibodies in blood samples by screening for HCV antigens, which would help decrease the chances of HCV infection from blood transfusions.",
