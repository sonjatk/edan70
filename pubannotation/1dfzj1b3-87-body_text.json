    "text": "The ability to inhibit IL-1β and IL-6 production but not TNF-α was attributed to 1,8-cineole, santoline, spathulenol and caryophyllene oxide, major constituents of the essential oil of Cinnamomum osmophloeum Kaneh. leaves [109] . Rosmarinus officinalis L. oil, mainly constituted by 1,8-cineole along with α-pinene, camphor and p-cymene was only able to reduce the pro-inflammatory IL-6 production in the mouse colon in which colitis was induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid (TNBS), not suppressing IL-1β [110] .",
