    "text": "To study the effects of contact tracing and isolation, we modify the assumptions of the SEIR epidemic model, while still incorporating gamma-distributed latent and infectious periods. In the new model, isolation of newly infectious cases occurs at a daily rate of d I after a delay of s D days, which represents a period when infected individuals are infectious but asymptomatic or undetectable (I A ). A fraction q of those who had contact with an infectious and symptomatic individual (I S ) (but did not contract the infection) are removed to the quarantined susceptible class, S Q , where they spend exactly s Q days. An identical fraction of newly exposed individuals is also quarantined. Full details of the model equations are given in Protocol S1.",
