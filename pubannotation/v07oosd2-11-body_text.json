    "text": "Housing factors, population density, parity segregated production and the feeding regimen after weaning play a role in the development of PWD [38] . It is beyond the scope of this review to discuss in detail all the ideal conditions for pig housing during the post-weaning period, but to highlight the most important, as reviewed by Le Dividich and Herpin [39] , it is essential to provide the correct environmental temperature, 26-28 Â°C, to maintain pigs in their thermo-neutral zone. Chilling reduces intestinal peristaltic activity and consequently increases bacterial colonization, and low temperatures in weaner facilities appears to be responsible for a more severe course of PWD [40] . Also, it has been shown that automatic temperature control in the weaners housing reduces considerably the prevalence of PWD [38] . Wathes and Whittemore [41] reviewed several recommendations to prevent pig diseases by appropriate housing and environmental management. These approaches involve avoiding drafts while removing moisture and gases using adequate ventilation. Most often, flat decks are used instead of soiled bedding for weaned piglets; however it was reported that this practice is accompanied by more tail and belly lesions among pigs [42] . Moreover, the removal of manure and soiled bedding on a regular basis is also important to reduce the microbial load on farms.",
