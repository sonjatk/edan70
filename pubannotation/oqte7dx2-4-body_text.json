    "text": "AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) mediate the majority of fast excitatory transmission in the brain, and regulation of synaptic AMPAR levels is important for controlling synapse development and function. AMPARs are assembled as hetero-tetramers comprised of various combinations of the pore-forming subunits GluA1-A4. Subunit composition and association with auxiliary subunits determine the biophysical and trafficking properties of the channel (Anggono and Huganir, 2012) . AMPARs can be regulated by multiple posttranslational modifications, such as ubiquitination, which controls receptor trafficking and degradation (Goo et al., 2015) . Studies of the AMPAR GLR-1, which shares 40%-50% identity with rat GluA1 and GluA2 (Hart et al., 1995; Brockie et al., 2001) , in C. elegans were the first to show that glutamate receptors (GluRs) are regulated by ubiquitin (Burbea et al., 2002) . Ubiquitin is directly conjugated to the cytoplasmic tail of GLR-1, providing a signal for clathrinmediated endocytosis and subsequent degradation (Burbea et al., 2002) . Later studies showed that all four mammalian AMPAR subunits, GluA1-A4, are also regulated by ubiquitin (Schwarz et al., 2010; Fu et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2011; Lussier et al., 2011; Widagdo et al., 2015) . Although several studies suggest that AMPARs are likely ubiquitinated at the plasma membrane prior to internalization (Burbea et al., 2002; Schwarz et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2011) , other studies propose that AMPARs are ubiquitinated at endosomes (Lussier et al., 2011; Widagdo et al., 2015) , prior to degradation in the lysosome. Future research will be necessary to determine if stimulus type, intensity or duration determine the subcellular site of ubiquitination.",
