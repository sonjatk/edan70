    "text": "According to the findings of the present study delays in diagnosis were due to the following factors: fear of stigma, patients' dissatisfaction with service from private healthcare providers, lack of knowledge, patients' beliefs, and patients choosing to consult traditional healers rather than healthcare facilities. The findings of this study concur with the study conducted by Mbuthia et al. [18] , many people in Africa visit traditional healers prior or concurrently with formal healthcare services. Delays in TB diagnosis is common in many regions worldwide, due to patient related factors, such as stigma, lack of information, dissatisfaction with TB service, inaccessibility of treatment, or provider-related factors such as diagnosis delay, knowledge and skills of healthcare workers, and inadequate infrastructure.",
