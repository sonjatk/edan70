    "text": "Recently the replication of IBV has been shown to induce autophagy in mammalian cells [55] . Furthermore, individual expression of IBV nsp6, as well as nsp6 homologues from other viruses in the Nidovirales order, has been shown to induce autophagy [55] . However, the mechanism by which this induction occurs is unknown. Whether nsp6 is responsible for inducing autophagy in the context of whole virus would also be interesting to discover. In addition, as IBV is restricted to avian species, would similar observations be made in a more natural host model? Finally, several studies have shown that coronavirus infection induces autophagy [9, [50] [51] [52] 54, 55] . However, the pathway does not appear to be required for virus replication [52, 53, 55, 56] . Therefore, is autophagy acting as a cellular defence to virus infection and does the virus have mechanisms to control this response?",
