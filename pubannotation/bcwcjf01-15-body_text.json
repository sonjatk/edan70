    "text": "Data analysis include 44 samples sequenced using 454 across 10,330 genome positions and 40 samples sequenced using Illumina across 10,379 genome positions. The minimum coverage cutoff was 506. After quality filtering, the mean coverage for the sequencing data was 9806 for 454 data and 17,4486 for Illumina ORP data, the median coverage was 7776 for 454 data and 15,7586 for Illumina ORP data (Fig. S1 ). In total, 10,451 positions of the rabies genome were sequenced by either 454 or Illumina, of these, 10330 positions (98.8% of 10,451 loci) were covered by both platforms, though not necessarily for all samples; an additional 36 positions (loci 5199-5206, 5215, 5216, 5218-5220, 5224, 9542-9563) were covered only by 454, and 85 positions (loci 183-267) were covered only by Illumina, also not necessarily for all samples. The few disagreements in consensus base calls between 454 and Illumina were resolved either by taking the base call with far superior coverage or omitting the base call from data analysis entirely. In most cases the disagreement was due to low coverage of the loci by one platform (just above the 506 cutoff) compared to coverage by the other platform (.5006). Hence the final consensus sequences of the two data sets contain no disagreement and can be considered accurate with high confidence.",
