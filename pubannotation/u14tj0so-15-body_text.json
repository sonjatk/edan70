    "text": "Based on our experiments on our HK-PK and HK-PKfree data sets that include 88 pseudoknotted structures, and 337 pseudoknot-free structures respectively, ranging in length from 10 to 400 nucleotides, a single run of Iterative HFold does not take more than 9 seconds time and 62 MB of memory. In contrast, one of the best heuristic methods, HotKnots V2.0, takes 1.7 hours and 91 GB of memory for a sequence with 400 nucleotides. Therefore our method is practical for prediction of long RNA structures. Iterative HFold bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval for average accuracy of pseudoknotted structures of the HK-PK data set is significantly higher than that of IPknot, ((72.83%, 83.37%) vs. (54.56%, 66.25%)) and is comparable to that of HotKnots V2.0, (vs. (73.60%, 83.35%)) two of the best prediction methods available. Iterative HFold's accuracy is significantly higher than that of IPknot and HotKnots on our IP-pk168 data set. Iterative HFold also has higher accuracy than HFold even when just partial information about the true pseudoknot-free structure is provided, so it is more robust than HFold. Specifically, Iterative HFold's average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increases from roughly 54% to 79% as the user provides up to 40% of the input structure, and improves with a more modest but still positive improvement in accuracy when further structural information is provided.",
