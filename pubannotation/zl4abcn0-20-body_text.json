    "text": "In search of optimal chromatographic conditions, different mobile phase compositions were investigated. The mobile phases were acetonitrile-deionised distilled water (ddH 2 O) at ratios of 40 : 60 v/v, 35 : 75 v/v, 30 : 70 v/v, 25 : 75 v/v, 20 : 80 v/v, and 15 : 85 v/v, each at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. All these mobile phases resulted in peak splitting and tailing. The retention time was longer than 5 min. This phenomenon may be due to the ionization of the compound in the column.",
