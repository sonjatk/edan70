    "text": "It has been shown previously that the inhibition of the proteasome leads to an accumulation of polyubiquitinated Gag species, which interfere with Gag-processing [38] . Later, it was shown that proteasome inhibitors interfere with HIV-1 replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) [64] . In this study, we could show that the addition of the DIs leads to an accumulation of polyubiquitinated Gag species and a reduction in Gag-processing. Thus, we speculated that the combinatory treatment of HLAC with DIs and proteasome inhibitors might synergistically inhibit virus replication. Si et al. have previously shown that DIs boost the inhibitory effect of proteasome inhibitors on Coxsackie virus replication [89] . However, in this case DIs alone had no effect on replication of Coxsackie virus and there was no supra-additive effect detectable, even when both inhibitors were added at high concentrations. Possibly, both inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors and DIs, are necessary Viruses 2017, 9, 222 16 of 22 to efficiently reduce the pool of free Ub, which has been shown to be necessary to block Coxsackie virus replication [89] . On the contrary, our data illustrate that DIs can enhance the effect of proteasome inhibitors on the inhibition of HIV-1 replication at very low, supra-effective concentration levels of both inhibitors. When applied individually, neither proteasome inhibitors nor DIs had any influence on the HIV-1 replication at these low concentrations. Thus, our results suggest that both inhibitors, DIs and proteasome inhibitors induce synergistic effects, without affecting cell viability.",
