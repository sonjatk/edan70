    "text": "Targeting polyamines as an antiviral strategy shows significant promise, and the availability of FDA-approved molecules like DFMO underscores the potential of inhibiting this pathway for limiting viral infection. We previously described how DFMO reduces CVB3 replication in vitro and in vivo [25] . Here, we show that CVB3 gains resistance to DFMO-mediated polyamine depletion via two distinct and independent mutations. Such emergence of resistance highlights that polyamine depletion as a monotherapy may not be sufficient to quell virus replication. As viruses rapidly mutate and gain resistance to antivirals, potential therapy that includes polyamine depletion would necessitate combination therapy to prevent resistance. Neither protease mutant exhibited an enhanced fitness phenotype, as we had observed with CHIKV mutants [31] , suggesting that even if this virus were to emerge, the mutation may not fix in a viral population not exposed to DFMO.",
