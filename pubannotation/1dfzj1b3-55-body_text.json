    "text": "As already reported above, there are researchers that prefer to evaluate the antioxidant activity of the essential oils through their ability to scavenge free radicals. There are several free radicals that can be used; nevertheless the fundamental principles involved may be the same. This method relies on the reduction of the blue-green cation radical of ABTS +• , by measuring the reduction of the radical cation as the percentage of inhibition of absorbance at 734 nm. The absorbance of the reaction mixture of ABTS and an antioxidant is compared to that of the Trolox ® standard, and the results are expressed in terms of Trolox ® equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) [59] .",
