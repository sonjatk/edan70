    "text": "The crystal structure of nsp1␤ ( Figure 1B ) reveals an overall ellipsoidal structure consisting of six ␣-helices and seven ␤-strands with two major domains, a 48-amino-acid N-terminal domain (NTD) and a C-terminal papain-like cysteine protease (PLP1␤) domain (32) . Within the latter domain, we previously identified a conserved motif 123 GKYLQRRLQ 131 (19) as a potential RNA binding motif (RBM) that forms one of three ␣ helices in the region between the catalytic residues of PLP1␤ (C 96 and H 165 ; Ref. 19 ). To investigate the importance of these activities to Nucleic Acids Research, 2016, Vol. 44, No. 12 5495 trans-activation of PRF, amino acid substitutions were introduced into the protease active site (C96S; PR) or within the putative nsp1␤ RBM (K 124 A/R 128 A, mutant RBM; previously described as mutant 1␤KO (Li et al., (19) ) and the expressed variants tested in RRL ( Figure 1D ). In this experiment, the protease-defective variant retained full activity, ruling out the involvement of the protease activity of nsp1␤ in the stimulation of PRF. In contrast, the RBM mutation prevented frameshifting, supporting a role for RNA binding by nsp1␤.",
