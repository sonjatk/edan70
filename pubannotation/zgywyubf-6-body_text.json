    "text": "In the present study, we report the ability of the ORF2 protein to inhibit the cellular NF-κB activity. In human hepatoma cells, ORF2 protein could directly associate with the F-box protein βTRCP and heterologous expression of the ORF2 protein led to reduced recruitment of SKP1 and CUL1 subunits to the SCF βTRCP ubiquitination complex, resulting in decreased ubiquitination and degradation of the IκBα protein. This, in turn, led to reduced nuclear localization and subsequent DNA binding of the p65 protein, which is the major subunit of the NF-κB trans-activation complex. Analysis of two NF-κB target genes further confirmed the above observation. The possible significance of this phenomenon in enhancing survival of HEV infected hepatocytes is discussed.",
