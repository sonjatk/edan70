    "text": "We began by analyzing mutation accumulation during the human H1N1 outbreak of 2009-2010, using strain California/04/2009 as a reference. This was the first sequenced genome of the outbreak included in Kedwaii, et al. [8] . We then calculated the extent of mutational divergence of all subsequent genomes over the duration of the outbreak.",
