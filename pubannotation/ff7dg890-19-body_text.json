    "text": "Some of these aspects can be explored by studying the range of model parameters that give (initial) outbreak dynamics consistent with the (short-term) epidemic data thus far gathered. One approach is to fit model parameters to data by ''trajectory matching,'' where one looks for the combination of parameters that, in a statistically rigorous sense, give rise to dynamics most consistent with observed patterns [34, 35] . Alternatively, one may use the well-established result that during the initial stages of an epidemic, the growth rate is approximately exponential [17, 20] , with the rate determined by R 0 . First, we use this approach to examine, in general, how the distribution of the latent and infectious periods may affect the estimation of R 0 from initial epidemic data. To illustrate that our results are not specific to this methodology, we then take incidence data from an influenza outbreak and parameterize the epidemic models using trajectory matching.",
