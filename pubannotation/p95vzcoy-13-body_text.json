    "text": "For the reverse transcription, we used the M-MLV RT (Promega, Dübendorf, Switzerland) Kit and followed the manufacturer's recommendations: Template RNA (50-500 µg, Table S1 ) was incubated with 0.75 µL of a random hexamer oligonucleotide (100 µM) and H 2 O for 5 min at 70 • C in a thermocycler (Biometra; Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany). For the cDNA synthesis, 5 µL 5× buffer, 1.125 µL nucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) 10 mM and 1 µL reverse transcriptase (M-MLV) was added to a final reaction volume of 25 µL, which was incubated at 37 • C for 60 min. The resulting cDNA was diluted 1/5 and stored at −25 • C until further processing.",
