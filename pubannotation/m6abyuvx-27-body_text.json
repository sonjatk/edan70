    "text": "In addition, we demonstrated that rVV-N25 treatment in the absence of CD4 and CD8 T cells had no effect on HCV clearance. This important observation indicated that rVV-N25-induced HCV clearance was mediated by CD4 and CD8 T cells. Many studies have shown that spontaneous viral clearance during acute HCV infection is characterized by a vigorous, broadly reactive CD4 and CD8 T-cell response. [8, 22] HCV clearance and hepatocellular cytotoxicity are both mediated by CD8 antigenspecific (cytotoxic T lymphocyte) CTLs [23] . Consistent with these observations, rVV-N25 treatment effectively induced the accumulation of NS2-specific CD8 T cells, which express high levels of Figure 6 . Immunization with rVV-N25 suppresses serum inflammatory cytokine levels. (A) Daily cytokine levels in the serum of CN2-29 (+/ 2) /MxCre (+/2) mice during the week following immunization with LC16m8, rVV-CN2, rVV-N25, or rVV-CN5. Values represent means 6 SD (n = 3) and reflect the concentrations relative to those measured on day 0. The broken lines indicate the baseline data from wild-type mice. In all cases, n = 6 mice per group. (B) Liver sections from CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) and CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (2/2) mice. (C) Histology activity index (HAI) scores of liver samples taken from CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2), or CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (2/2) mice. (D) Liver sections from CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice in which TNF-a was neutralized and the IL-6 receptor was blocked. The scale bars indicate 50 mm. (E) HAI scores of liver samples taken from CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) in which TNF-a was neutralized and the IL-6 receptor was blocked. Tg and non-Tg indicate CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) and CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (2/2) , respectively. (F) Macrophages were the main producers of TNF-a and IL-6 in CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice following poly(I:C) injection. (G) Immunization with rVV-N25 reduced the number of macrophages in liver samples from CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice and suppressed TNF-a and IL-6 production from macrophages ( Figure 6G ). Significant relationships are indicated by a P-value. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0051656.g006",
