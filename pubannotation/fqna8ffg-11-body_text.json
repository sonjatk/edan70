    "text": "We first performed a time course analysis to determine the starting point of the onset of the inflammatory response on the cellular as well as the molecular level. Accordingly, mice were sacrificed 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 h and 3 or 7 days past a single IT dose of 20 Î¼g CNP, and BAL was analyzed for the influx of inflammatory cells and cytokines, and by qPCR for proinflammatory gene expression in lung homogenates. Counting the frequency of BAL cells with visible inclusions of back particle agglomerates (CNP) revealed a rapid increase of particle laden macrophages from 50 % already 3 h, to 90 % 12 h after CNP exposure. No CNP uptake was detected for neutrophils and free agglomerates were virtually absent for time points later than 12 h after CNP exposure (Fig. 2) .",
