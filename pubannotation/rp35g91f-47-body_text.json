    "text": "Of particular interest in our gene network is the expression of Cacna2d2 which codes for the a-2/d subunit of the voltage-dependent calcium channel complex, a subunit that is highly and predominantly expressed in the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes (Marionneau et al. 2005) . This gene is expressed at low levels in our gene network but is regulated from a suggestive eQTL on Chr1: 33 (one of the three loci from which our gene network is coregulated). Since expression of this subunit is associated with nodal tissues, upregulation of Cacna2d2, subsequent to dysregulation of our gene network, could predispose to gain of pacemaker activity. In support of this, Cacna2d2 expression is reported to be highly sensitive to dosage of the transcription factor TBX5 (Mori et al. 2006) , another gene in our extended gene network. TBX5 is an essential factor for development of the cardiac conduction system including the atrioventricular bundle and bundle branches (Arnolds et al. 2012; Mori et al. 2006; Moskowitz et al. 2004 ). TBX5 has also been shown to interact and cooperate with both NKX2-5 (Hiroi et al. 2001; Puskaric et al. 2010 ) and GATA4 (Munshi et al. 2009 ) (also in our gene network) to drive commitment to a nodal cell phenotype (Stefanovic et al. 2014 ). Since NKX2-5 is known to suppress the nodal phenotype (Ye et al. 2015) , a fine balance between TBX5 interactions with NKX2-5 vs. GATA4 may underlie the maintenance of the working myocardium in the pulmonary myocardium.",
