    "text": "Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccine is used to prevent tuberculous meningitis, miliary tuberculosis and possibly other forms of tuberculosis, including pulmonary disease, in children [1, 2] . It is included as part of the expanded programme on immunization in over 150 countries worldwide, including Malaysia [3] . In Malaysia, as in most countries where it is used, BCG vaccination is recommended universally for all infants at birth or shortly after birth. Following intradermal inoculation of the attenuated Mycobacterium bovis BCG strain at the deltoid region of the left arm, a small papule usually appears after 2 weeks, gradually enlarges and typically ulcerates within 2-4 months, and slowly heals over the next few months to form the BCG scar [4] .",
