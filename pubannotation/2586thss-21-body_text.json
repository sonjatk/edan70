    "text": "The HCV NS3 protein is composed of an amino terminal protease and a carboxyl terminal RNA helicase (21) . NS3 contains major antigenic epitopes and plays an important role in the diagnosis of HCV infection, particularly in early HCV infection (21) . In this study, to our knowledge, our results demonstrate for the first time that a new NS3 segment (1183-1476 aa) shows strong reactivity in 95.6% of RT-PCRpositive samples and can act as a potential tool for the diagnosis of HCV infection.",
