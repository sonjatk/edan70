    "text": "The reduction in eIF4G cleavage by viral protease in the presence of polyamine depleting molecules could be the result of polyamines modulating viral protease activity, or the phenotype could be due to restriction of virus replication, protease translation, and subsequent reduction in proteolytic activity. To directly measure viral protease activity in cells, we generated a proteasesensitive dual luciferase reporter system. In this split luciferase system, cleavage of a target sequence allows for robust firefly luciferase activity, which can be normalized to a renilla luciferase transfection control. This system has previously been used to explore the activity of viral polymerases [34] [35] [36] , though it has not been considered in the context of polyamine depletion. To generate this system, we ",
