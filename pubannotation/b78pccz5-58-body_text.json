    "text": "The calculations assume that all indoor originating exposures follow the mass-balance dilution even though this is not self-evident for several indoor originating pollutants, especially radon, dampness, mould and carbon monoxide. Radon infiltrates typically from the soil below the buildings, and the infiltration may react to the under pressure indoors, which may increase in some ventilation systems at higher ventilation rates.",
