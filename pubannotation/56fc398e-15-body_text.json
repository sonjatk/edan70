    "text": "We consider three methods of node sampling in this paper. In the first method, we use random node sampling (RNS) such that all movements from a certain percentage of nodes are selected. A more advanced form of node sampling is SBS [36] . In this method, an initial set of nodes are sampled at random. At the next stage, the nodes captured by the initial sampled nodes are in turn sampled. This process can continue until all nodes have been sampled. In this paper, we consider second-order SBS, such that an initial set of nodes are sampled and the nodes that this set of nodes are connected to are also sampled.",
