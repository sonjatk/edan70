    "text": "Several viral proteins have been observed to associate with eEF1A. The nucleocapsid protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) could modulate cell cytokinesis and proliferation via interacting with eEF1A [28] . eEF1A also interacts with the nucleocapsid protein of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and regulates the virus replication [29] . Furthermore, eEF1A can be utilized as the cofactors of the viral RNA synthesis for several viruses, such as HIV-1 [22, 23] , TBSV [21] and WNV [30] . Previous studies on turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) and TBSV have shown that eEF1A interacts primarily with the viral RdRp complex, and thus acts as a chaperone and supports viral replication [31] [32] [33] . As members of Flaviviridae, both BVDV NS5A and HCV NS4A interact with eEF1A [24, 34] . Thereinto, the exact role of eEF1A on the BVDV replication remains unclear [24] . The HCV NS4A inhibits the viral IRES-mediated translation, and the translation inhibitory effect of NS4A was relieved by the addition of purified recombinant eEF1A in the in vitro translation system [34] . However, we showed here that eEF1A negatively regulates the CSFV growth. We conclude that the different roles of eEF1A in viral replication may vary depending on the distinct interactions between eEF1A and different viruses. In this study, the eEF1A was shown to bind to the IRES and inhibit its activity, thus it is possible to suppress the CSFV replication.",
