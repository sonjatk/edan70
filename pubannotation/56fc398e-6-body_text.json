    "text": "In situations where only partial network information is available, it may be necessary to reconstruct the network. Different approaches can be applied to construct contact networks. The most basic methods involve random sampling of nodes (i.e. individuals or farms [28] ) or random sampling of edges (i.e. links between nodes). However, it may be possible to capture the key properties of a network more efficiently using an approach such as snowball sampling (SBS). SBS is typically used in situations where the target population is small and hard to find. A number of individuals from the target population are asked to nominate an x number of people from the target population [29] . This method has been used previously to identify networks of sexual contacts for HIV-positive individuals [30] . In the case of livestock, when there may be knowledge regarding the size of farms or number of aggregated movements from a farm ( per year), a targeted sampling approach could be used where larger farms or farms with the highest number of movements are sampled. When constructing networks, including specific network characteristics (such as age structure) improves the quality of the constructed network [31] . Previous studies have shown that subsets of networks are not always representative of the whole network (e.g. scale-free networks [28] ). Therefore, caution is needed when networks are constructed with partial data.",
