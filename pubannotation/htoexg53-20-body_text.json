    "text": "T cell responses against coronaviruses are known to be long lived and mostly target the more conserved CoV internal structural N protein. However, information on MERS-CoV N antigen-specific T cell specificities is still limited. Thus, we aimed first to identify N polypeptide-specific T cell epitopes in BALB/c mice immunized twice with recombinant virus MVA-MERS-N or non-recombinant MVA as a control via the intraperitoneal and intramuscular routes. Eight days after the final immunization, splenocytes were prepared and the purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were restimulated in vitro with overlapping peptides corresponding to the N protein. Overlapping peptides were pooled using a two-dimensional, pooled-peptide matrix system (Table S1 ) and screened by IFN-γ ELISPOT. The stimulation of splenoctyes from MVA-MERS-N immunized mice with the peptides from 16 out of the total 18 peptide pools did not result in the detection of IFN-γ producing T cells above background numbers obtained with splenocytes from mock or MVA-control vaccinated animals. Stimulation with the peptides from pools H8 (n = 10) and V8 (n = 10) as well as the use of the vaccinia virus positive peptide F2L [49] (data not shown) showed elevated numbers of IFN-γ spot forming cells (SFC) in CD8+ T cell cultures (Figure 3a,b) . MVA-MERS-N immunizations given by i.p. and i.m. routes resulted in comparable T cell stimulatory capacities of overlapping N-specific peptides from pools V8 and H8. In contrast, peptides from other pools showed no or only minor stimulatory activities, as exemplified for peptides in pools V4 and V6. ",
