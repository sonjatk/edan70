    "text": "RNA molecules are crucial in different levels of cellular function, ranging from translation and regulation of genes to coding for proteins [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Understanding the structure of an RNA molecule is important in inferring its function [7] [8] [9] [10] . Since experimental methods for determining RNA structure, such as X-ray, crystallography and NMR, are time consuming, expensive and in some cases infeasible, http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/147 based on thermodynamic parameters derived in part from experimental data [23] . While thermodynamics-based approaches can be less accurate than comparative-based algorithms, thermodynamics-based approaches are applicable in cases of novel RNAs such as the many RNAs of unknown function recently reported by the ENCODE consortium [24] . Thermodynamics-based approaches can also be easier to apply to prediction of the structure of interacting RNA molecules, for example, in gene knockdown studies.",
