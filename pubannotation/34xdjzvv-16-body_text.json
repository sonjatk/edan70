    "text": "Several large epidemics of severe forms of EV71 infection in young children are associated with neurological diseases that may occasionally cause permanent paralysis or death [29] [30] [31] . In our study, we showed that N3 protected hSCARB2-transgenic mice from being infected (Fig. 4) ; viral load from different tissues (CNS and muscle) of N3-treated hSCARB2-transgenic mice was markedly reduced in contrast to non-treated groups (Fig. 5-6 ). These results indicate that the reduction of viral load in the compartment of CNS by N3 may correlate to the protection. Indeed, several studies of people and mice have also suggested the possibility of EV71-induced immunopathogenesis [19, 32] . Clinical, radiological, and laboratory features indicated that immunpathology resulting in neurological disease were reported in severe cases [33] . Elevated levels of several cytokines and chemokines have been reported in children with brainstem encephalitis and PE [13, 15] . CXCL10, CCL3, IL-6, TNF-a, IL-1b, and Type 1 and type II IFNs were found to be significantly elevated in EV71infected hSCARB2-transgenic mice. After N3 treatment, reduction of proinflammatory mediators release was observed (Fig. 7, 8 , 9) . Moreover, similar results were reported in clinical cases that IFN-c, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-13 levels in the blood were significantly decreased in EV71 patients with PE after administration of IVIG. Beside EV71, coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis is primarily attributed to viremic injury, and immune infiltration and reclamation [34, 35] . Both innate immune response and specific host effector mechanisms were also reported to be involved in the CNS of coronavirus infection [36] .",
