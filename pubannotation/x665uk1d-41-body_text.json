    "text": "Three 3D8 scFv TG mouse lines and the wild-type C57BL/6 line were divided into five groups with or without PRV infection (WT-mock, WT-PRV, STG69-PRV, STG90-PRV, and STG135-PRV). Mice were challenged with PRV by intramuscular injection (10 LD 50 ). Survival rates in each group were calculated at 12 hr intervals ( Figure S5 ). Tissues (muscle and brain) were harvested and stored at 270uC for further RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses.",
