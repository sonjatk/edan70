    "text": "Immune responses and protection against ZIKV in mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR − / − ) following immunisation with the ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine Mechanisms of ZIKV-induced disease and immunity are poorly defined, and the protective versus the hypothetical pathogenic nature of the immune response to ZIKV infection is as yet unclear. 17 Most strains of mice are resistant to ZIKV infection, however, mice lacking IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR − / − ) were found to be susceptible to infection and disease with most succumbing within 6-7 days post challenge. 18 The ability of the consensus ZIKV-prME plasmid vaccine to induce cellular and humoral immune responses in this mouse strain was investigated. Five to six week old female IFNAR − / − mice (n = 4) were immunised i.m., with electroporation-mediated delivery, three times at 2-week intervals with either the control pVax1 plasmid or ZIKV-prME vaccine plasmid vaccine. The serum was collected from immunised mice at days 0, 14, 21, and 35, and splenocytes were harvested from mice 1 week following the final immunisation (day 35). The splenocytes from vaccine-immunised mice produced a clear cellular immune response as indicated by levels of SFU per 10 6 cells in an ELISpot assay (Supplementary Figure S3A) . The results from ELISA analysis, using rZIKV-E as a capture antigen, show detectable anti-ZIKV serum IgG by day 14 (titres of~1:1,000) and these levels were boosted with subsequent vaccinations with binding antibody titres reaching at least 1:100,000 (Supplementary Figure S3B ,C). By comparison, the PRNT 50 titre for the day 35 postimmunisation samples was 1:60 (data not shown). The results indicate that IFNAR − / − mice immunised with the consensus ZIKV-prME vaccine are capable of generating anti-ZIKV cellular and humoral immune responses supporting further study in this model of putative vaccine effects in a pathogenic challenge.",
