    "text": "To assess the effects of G2/M phase synchronization, cells were cultured in medium or were treated with 25 ng/ml nocodazole for 24 h; then, the cells were mock infected or were infected with EV-D68 at 0.8 MOI for 2 h, and cultured in fresh medium or 25 ng/ml nocodazole for another 24 h ( Figure 1I ). Nododazole induced obvious G2/M arrest (P < 0.001; Figure 1J ). At 2 h post-infection, there was no significant difference in the genomic RNA level in the control and G2/M phase-synchronized cells ( Figure 1M) ; however, at 24 h post-infection the genomic level was lower in the synchronized cells than in the control cells (P < 0.05; Figure 1K ). Furthermore, at 24 h post-infection the TCID50/mL for supernatant from the G2/M phase-synchronized cells (0.46 ± 0.29 × 10 5 ) was obviously lower than that from the control cells (1.40 ± 0.16 × 10 5 ) (P < 0.01; Figure 1L ). Therefore, these results suggest that G2/M synchronization does not affect viral entry, but inhibits EV-D68 viral replication and production.",
