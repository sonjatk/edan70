    "text": "MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV are two highly pathogenic coronaviruses that have caused hundreds of deaths. On one hand, the development of relevant prophylactic and therapeutic agents has been well under way. [55] [56] [57] On the other hand, the identification of the pathogenic factors in these viruses is also in full swing. The M protein is a pathogenic factor by virtue of its IFN-antagonizing property. Both the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV M proteins were found to suppress IFN production with a highly similar mechanism in which the IRF3phosphorylating complex of TRAF3·TANK·TBK1/IKK-ε was affected by their N-terminal transmembrane domains. 30, 32 Interestingly, in the case of community-acquired human coronavirus HKU1, which normally causes common cold in infected individuals, its M protein showed no IFN antagonistic property, 32 further supporting the importance of the M protein in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pathogenesis. Using a side-by-side comparison of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV M proteins, we discovered that the extent by which the MERS-CoV M protein suppressed IFN-β promoter activity was lower than that by SARS-CoV M protein. This difference might be explained by the strengths of the interaction of MERS-CoV M protein with other transducers. Whereas the MERS-CoV M protein was found to be strongly associated with TRAF3, its interaction with TBK1 or IKK-ε was undetectable (data not shown). This distinguished MERS-CoV M protein from the SARS-CoV M protein, which interacts potently with every component of the TRAF3·TANK·TBK1/IKK-ε complex. 30 Further investigations are required to shed light on how the interaction of the M protein with TRAF3 complex might influence MERS-CoV pathogenesis.",
