    "text": "Additional file 1: Figure S1 . Expression of IFITMs does not grossly affects viral production and does not modify the Env to Gag ratio of viral particles. A) The overall amount of viral particles produced upon co-transfection of HEK293T cells with DNAs coding HIV-1 vectors and IFITMs was quantified by exo-RT activity. B) The amount of Env and of CA present in exo-RT normalized viruses obtained in the presence or absence of IFITMs was determined by ELISA and is presented here as a gp120/p24 ratio. The graphs present averages and SEM obtained with 3 to 8 independent experiments. *p â‰¤ 0,05, according to a Student t test.",
