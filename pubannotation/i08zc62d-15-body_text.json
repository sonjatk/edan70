    "text": "The crystal structure also provides an explanation for the weak inhibition shown by the parent eriodictyol and three other geranylated flavonoids (3 0 -O-methyldiplacone, 4 0 -Omethyldiplacone and mimulone) studied in this manuscript (Table 2; Fig. 2b ). The geranyl group made a suitable hydrophobic interaction with four aromatic residues: Phe353, Trp354, Phe460 and Tyr587. Therefore Table 2 Structures and inhibitory activities (IC 50 ) of flavonoid-based Cp-NanI inhibitors. of Ala292 and the side chains of Ile327 and Phe347. On the other hand, eliminating the C3 0 hydroxyl group (mimulone, IC 50 of 6.1 mM) does not lead to structural clashes with the protein but prevents hydrogen-bond formation. Therefore, maintaining the geranyl and C3 0 hydroxyl group is important for the further development of diplacone-based Cp-NanI inhibitors.",
