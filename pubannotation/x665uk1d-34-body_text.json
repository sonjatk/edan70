    "text": "Quantification of HSV-1 DNA and RNA from cells of SCH07072, muSCH, and HeLa was carried out by harvesting the cells at 2 hours post infection (HPI) with HSV-1, 6.5 HPI, and 25 HPI for immediate early stage, early stage, and late stage, respectively as summarized in Figure 5A . RNA was isolated from cells and mouse tissues (liver, muscle, lung, and brain) using Corezol reagent (CoreBio System) [41] . cDNA was synthesized from 5 mg of total RNA using random hexamers and MMLV reverse transcriptase (SuperBio). All primers were designed using the Primer 3 program. The expression levels of immediate early genes [ICP0 (transcriptional transactivator) and ICP4 (regulatory protein)] [42, 43] , early genes [UL9 (replication origin binding) and UL29 (single-strand binding protein)] [44, 45] and late genes [UL19 (capsid protein) and UL38 (capsid assembly)] [46, 47] were analyzed by Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia) ( ",
