    "text": "As expected, Saudi Arabia had the highest number of publications returned when searching for bat-associated CoV research in Western Asia (Table S4) , likely because bats are the presumed evolutionary source of the MERS-CoV, a virus that still infects a large number of people each year in the country due to the transmission from dromedary camels to humans [40, 43] . In the absence of many primary studies on CoVs in bats from the region, our PubMed searches would have also identified publications that mention bats in the abstracts and titles, e.g., of review papers [126] [127] [128] [129] . Bat-CoV characterization from Saudi Arabia [40] and Lebanon [130] are two of the notable studies that reported primary results from on-the-ground virus surveillance efforts. More than half of the countries in Western Asia had no published research on bat-associated CoVs (Table 1) , demonstrating a significant gap for a viral family that can cause severe morbidity in human and domestic animal populations.",
