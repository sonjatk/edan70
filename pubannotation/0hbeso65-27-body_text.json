    "text": "Using a functional RNAi kinase screen, recent study identified epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ephrin receptor A2 (EPHA2), two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) which regulate a number of key cellular functions, as host factors for HCV entry [103] . The results showed that the identified RTKs mediated HCV entry by regulating CD81claudin-1 coreceptor associations and viral glycoproteindependent membrane fusion, implying that inhibition of RTK function may constitute a new approach for the prevention and treatment of HCV infection.",
