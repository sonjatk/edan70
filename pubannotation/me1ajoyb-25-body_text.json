    "text": "Metabolic products can provide substantial information about the interactions of viruses and infected host cells, and the how immune system responds to infection [103, 104] . The field of metabolomics is young but potentially informative for understanding hantavirus/reservoir host interactions. Many viruses metabolically remodel the host cell to optimize infection. Because metabolic products (e.g., carbohydrates, lipids, prostaglandins, etc.) are identical or highly similar between vertebrate species, this approach may help identify which enzymes, by virtue of their metabolic products, may be targeted by hantaviruses. While there are no reports of metabolic assessment of hantavirus infections, Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) modulates the activity of adenosine 5' monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in infected cells. This enzyme is a regulator of several metabolic pathways, including enhancement of catabolic pathways such as autophagy and ATP production, but it represses anabolic pathways, such as lipid biosynthesis. Infection of cells by several viruses, including RVFV, results in activation of AMPK and restriction of viral replication, suggesting an antiviral role for this enzyme [105] . Other studies have revealed metabolic pathway targeting by viruses [106] [107] [108] , thus efforts to examine how hantaviruses may manipulate the metabolomes of infected cells could lead to the identification of therapeutic targets for treating hantavirus disease.",
