The saliva pool from Amazonas had no matching Bartonella-like reads or contigs (S4 Table) , while one read each from the Loreto and Cajamarca saliva pool was assigned as Bartonella by nucleotide BLAST; however, these reported species assignments should be Table) . Bartonella sequences from this study are displayed with genotype, bat ID numbers, and accession numbers. Sequences from GenBank are colored by host taxa and provided with accession numbers, species, and sampling location. Diamonds depict posterior probabilities of nodes greater than 50%. interpreted cautiously as they are based on one read and percent identity was low. Pooled fecal samples from all departments of Peru contained Bartonella-like reads and contigs. Bartonella ancashensis, B. australis, and B. bacilliformis were all identified at both the read and contig level in fecal samples. However, because percent identity was relatively low, species assignments should again be interpreted cautiously. Subsequent BLAST hits following the top hit also frequently (though not always) matched to Bartonella, suggesting the presence of poorly characterized Bartonella species present or that these may be matches to other bacteria.",
