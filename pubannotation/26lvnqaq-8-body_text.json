    "text": "A low pathogenicity AI (LPAI) virus of the H9N2 subtype belonging to the G1 lineage [22] , A/chicken/ Israel/1163/2011 was isolated at the Kimron Veterinary Institute from swabs collected during surveillance activities, in Israel [23] . A viral stock was produced by inoculating 9-to-11-day-old embryonated specific pathogen free (SPF) hen's eggs, via the allantoic cavity and was subsequently titrated according to the Reed and Muench method [24] , to determine the embryo infectious dose 50% (EID 50 ). The stock was screened to exclude the presence of bacterial agents and common viruses of poultry as previously described [25] . The low pathogenicity of the virus had already been confirmed in a previous experimental study by calculating the intravenous pathogenicity index [26] that resulted to be 0. The nucleotide sequence of the hemagglutinin gene was made available in the GenBank database under the Accession Number JQ973659 by Davidson et al. [23] . The virus stock used in this studies had a history of three passages in embryonated chicken eggs.",
