    "text": "Both assays have led to novel findings that re-enforce the importance of sensitive molecular diagnostic techniques in wildlife disease surveillance studies, where the use of gross lesions and/or less sensitive molecular methods are likely to underestimate pathogen prevalence. While all the red squirrel cases suspected of having SQPV based on gross post-mortem findings were positive for SQPV when assayed using qPCR, an additional case of SQPV was discovered that had gastrointestinal pathology recorded as the cause of death. Similarly, gastrointestinal lesions have been reported in a single SQPVinfected red squirrel in Northern Ireland (Collins et al. 2014 ). Other SQPV-infected red squirrels in this study yielded SQPV in the gastrointestinal tract, with an increase in RQ passing through the gastrointestinal tract potentially indicating replication within the intestine. The oropharynx is also reported to be a site of replication in red squirrels (Fiegna et al. 2016) .",
