    "text": "Spray dried plasma (SDP) is a protein rich product obtained from the industrial fractionation of blood from healthy animals [106] . It was shown that addition of SDP to the feed improved growth performance, and protects pigs against ETEC: F4 infection by reducing the intestinal expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-Î± and interleukin-8 and maintaining mucosal integrity, and enhancing specific antibody defense [111] . Spray dried plasma (SDPP) of porcine origin has been pinpointed as a potential source for the coronavirus in a recent epidemic of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) [136] . Thus, spray-dried chicken plasma (SDCP) has been evaluated as a replacement for SDPP in weaned pigs. Indeed, the effect of SDCP on serum biochemistry, intestinal barrier function, immune parameters, and the expression of intestinal development-related genes in piglets was similar to SDPP [137] . Nevertheless, a study has provided evidence that PED virus is inactivated during the SDPP production process [138] .",
