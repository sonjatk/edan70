    "text": "Influenza is one of the most common vaccine-preventable viral diseases, with the highest morbidity reported for children and elderly patients [1, 2] . Influenza infections during childhood usually present as mild respiratory upper airway disease, but severe complications and fatalities also occur, especially in children less than 2 years of age and in children with underlying chronic conditions [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . However, 40-50 % of influenza-associated fatalities occur in previously healthy children [4, 8] .",
