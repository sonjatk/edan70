    "text": "It is commonly accepted that ubiquitin plays an important role in retrovirus budding, but its mode of function, particularly in HIV-1 late replication steps, has been controversially discussed [38, 69, 70] . Although some studies suggest that the monoubiquitination of Gag contributes to efficient virus particle release via the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) [31, 71, 72] more recent studies indicate that ubiquitination of Gag can occur independently of the ESCRT-complex and might be dispensable to drive viral particle release [26, 32, 34, 73, 74] . Moreover, it was demonstrated that the mutation of the PTAP-motif within p6 causes enhanced ubiquitination of Gag due to its prolonged membrane association [25, 26] . This process has been ascribed to the interaction of Gag with a complex consisting of CCDC8, Obsl1, and the E3 ligase Cul7 at the plasma membrane [34] . In addition, it has been shown very recently that the highly conserved S40 and the glutamic acids within p6 can regulate the association of Gag with membranes and thus its entry into the UPS and MHC-I pathway [32, 33] . Mutation of these motifs leads to a prolonged membrane association of Gag and thus an enhanced entry into the UPS. These observations led us to speculate that in the wt situation certain DUBs interact with p6 or other domains of Gag, remove polyubiquitin chains, and thereby regulate its entry into the UPS. In this study, we could show that DIs, especially those inhibiting USP7 and USP47, enhance the entry of Gag into the UPS and thus into the MHC-I pathway, indicating that specific DUBs play an important role in the regulation of Gag ubiquitination. Moreover, Gag processing was impaired upon DI treatment, resulting in a reduced infectivity and replication capacity of HIV-1, which can be boosted by combinatory treatment with proteasome inhibitors.",
