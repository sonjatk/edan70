    "text": "Together, our data indicate that pDC's activated in a TLR7dependent manner are primarily responsible for the rapid systemic IFNa response following infection of mice with LDV. Furthermore, the interferon response was most likely responsible for the transient expression of the CD69 very early activation marker on lymphocytes during acute LDV infection. IFNa-dependent, partial activation of lymphocytes has also been reported during acute infection with Semliki forest virus [20] , human adenovirus 2, West Nile virus, and A/WSN influenza virus [32] in mice. However, not all acute viral infections induce partial activation, as it does not occur in Friend retrovirus infections of mice [16] . Such broad activation is by definition non-specific, and leaves open the question of how it benefits the host. Alsharifi et al. have proposed that IFNa-induced partial activation may promote adaptive immune responses by lowering the threshold for full activation once antigen-specific recognition occurs [33] . If so, IFNa may be a very important regulatory link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. Based on the findings that CD69 acts downstream of IFNa to inhibit lymphocyte egress from lymphoid organs [17] , it is also likely that CD69 expression facilitates sustained contacts between lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells during inflammatory responses, thereby enhancing full activation of antigen-specific lymphocytes. 0049 by t test) . A representative histogram of CD69 expression on cells from LDVinfected mice that were pDC-depleted pDC 2 ) or mock-treated (pDC + ) is shown. The histograms of cells from na√Øve animals overlapped with the curves from pDC depleted mice (data not shown). (C) pDC depletion did not significantly alter LDV levels in plasma as indicated by results from semiquantitative real-time RT-PCR as previously described [16] . Relative LDV levels are indicated by real time PCR critical threshold (Ct) values, which were not significantly different between LDV-infected normal mice (pDC + ) Ct = 22.05+/20.33, and LDV-infected, pDC-depleted mice (pDC 2 ) Ct = 21.72+/20.43 (n = 5). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0006105.g003 TLR7 wild type and knockout mice on the 129SvEv genetic background were infected with LDV and blood was analyzed at 16hpi. (A) IFNa levels in plasma were significantly reduced in TLR7 2/2 mice as measured by ELISA (PBL Interferon Source). Values in TLR7 +/+ mice averaged 795.5 pg/ml while only trace amounts of IFNa were detected in TLR7 2/2 mice ( TLR7 +/+ vs. TLR7 2/2 p = 0.0041 by T test). (B) The low levels of IFNa in TLR7 2/2 mice correlated with reduced percentages of lymphocytes expressing CD69 (TLR7 +/+ 57.30%+/24.15% CD69 + vs. TLR7 2/2 4.37%+/20.28% CD69 + , n = 3, p = 0.0002 by t test). (C) LDV-specific semiquantitative real-time RT-PCR as previously described [16] revealed no significant difference in virus levels between TLR7 knockout and TLR7 wild type mice as measured by critical threshold values (TLR7 +/+ Ct = 25.93+/20.59 vs. TLR7 2/2 26.90+/20.38, n = 3 mice/ group). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0006105.g004",
