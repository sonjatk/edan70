    "text": "In contrast to the protection of N3 against the infection of EV71 in hSCARB3-transgenic mice, administration of the same amount of antibody did not protect hSCARB3-transgenic mice from lethal CVA16 infection. Investigation of the affinity of N3 against CVA16 showed lower reactivity. We have identified that N3 specifically recognized a VP1 epitope (210-225 amino acid of VP1 region or named 776-790 encoded residues of EV71 genome; [17] ). In comparison of the recent study [37] , alignment of the highly conserved region of VP1 amino acid (200-225) sequences from different EV71 genotypes and CVA16 showed dissimilarity between CVA16 and EV71, which may explain the scenario that N3 failed to cross-neutralize CVA16 was due to the different sequence. The epitope recognized by N3 is also different from the previous report's epitopes; the mouse anti-sera generated from the peptides, P230-323, P646-755, P857-1012 and P1329-1440, showed strong staining with neuron plasma in both adult human cerebra and fetus medulla. N3 only closely met with the peptide P746-876 which elicits weak cross-reactivity to human tissues [38] .",
