    "text": "Spillover events are complex and usually require successful alignment of several contributing factors [47] . One such critical factor is increased shedding of virus by bats. This factor is influenced by the host response and virus replication. Plowright et al. [47] proposed a hypothesis which states that viruses infect na√Øve susceptible bats leading to acute infection. This subsequently progresses to a chronic or latent infection. The virus then reactivates from time to time in response to a variety of physiological and environmental triggers. This hypothesis is called the SILI hypothesis: Susceptible-Infectious-Latent-Infectious [47] . As described above, the bat immune system is unique and virus infection probably persists in many bats.",
