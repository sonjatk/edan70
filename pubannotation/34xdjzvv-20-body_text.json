The animal-use protocols were reviewed and approved by the NHRI Institutional Figure 6 . N3 inhibited viral loads of the tissues from hSCARB2-transgenic mice preinfected with EV71 5746. 7-day old hSCARB2transgenic mice were challenged with 1610 5 pfu of 5746 and followed by receiving 200 mg N3 or isotype antibodies at 3 h post infection. Infected mice received no antibody were included. On day 6 post infection, mice were sacrificed and RNAs were extracted from the brainstem, spinal cord, muscle, skin, and intestine for quantitative RT-PCR using primers specific to VP1 region of P1 transcripts. Virus copy numbers were calculated using a standard curve shown by purified EV71. A schematic representation of the virus copy number and the statistical average from 11 mice per group is shown. The unpaired student t test with Welch correction was used for statistical analysis. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0069858.g006",
