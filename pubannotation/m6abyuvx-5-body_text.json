    "text": "To produce adult mice that express an HCV transgene, we bred CN2-29 transgenic mice, which carry an HCV transgene, [5, 6, 9] with Mx1-Cre transgenic mice [10] , which express Cre recombinase in response to interferon (IFN)-a or a chemical inducer of IFN-a, poly(I:C) ( Figure 1A ). Following poly(I:C) injection, the HCV transgene was rearranged, and HCV sequences were expressed in the livers of F1 progeny (CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice) within 7 days after poly(I:C) injection ( Figure 1B) .",
