    "text": "Despite the several limitations, our paper points out some important differences in asthma exacerbations between preschool-and school-aged children concerning etiology and seasonal trends, specific for our climate. It also highlights the need for an improved management of asthmatic patients outside the ED and a tighter connection with outpatients' services: individualized written action plans should always be available; moreover, recommending vaccinations and allergen-avoidance measures might be useful, as well as prescribing controller medications at ED discharge in those patients with known chronic asthma and under no therapy.",
