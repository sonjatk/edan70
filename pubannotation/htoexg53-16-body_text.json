    "text": "IFN-γ-producing T cells were measured using ELISPOT assays (Elispot kit for mouse IFN-γ, MABTECH, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 × 10 6 splenocytes were seeded in 96-well plates (Sarstedt, Nürnbrecht, Germany) and stimulated with peptide pools or individual peptides (2 µg peptide/mL RPMI 1640 medium) at 37 • C for 48 h. Non-stimulated cells and cells treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (SIGMA-ALDRICH) and ionomycin (SIGMA-ALDRICH, Taufkirchen, Germany) or MVA F2L [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] peptide (F2L, SPGAAGYDL, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Planegg, Germany) [49] served as negative and positive controls, respectively. Automated ELISPOT plate reader software (A.EL.VIS Eli.Scan, A.EL.VIS ELISPOT Analysis Software, Hannover, Germany) was used to count and analyze spots.",
