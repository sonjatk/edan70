    "text": "While these mutations were obtained from a serial passage in DFMO-treated cells, we wished to determine whether these mutations conferred resistance to polyamine depletion and were not a consequence of a pleiotropic effect from DFMO. Toward this end, we treated cells with a different polyamine-depleting agent, diethylnorspermidine (DENSpm), which acts to accelerate polyamine catabolism by acetylating spermidine and spermine. Vero cells were treated with 100 µM DENSpm for 16 h prior to infection at MOI 0.1 with wildtype and mutant CVB3. At 48 hpi, we measured viral titers, and again we observed significant sensitivity with the wildtype virus ( Figure 2D ). However, we observed partial resistance in our protease mutant viruses. As with DFMO, when we calculated the percent replication in DENSpm-treated cells compared to untreated cells, the protease mutants exhibited resistance that was additive ( Figure 2E ). We verified that both of these molecules were depleting polyamines in our treated cells by directly visualizing polyamines via thin-layer chromatography ( Figure 2F ).
