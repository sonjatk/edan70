    "text": "Recent occurrences of pandemics like the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Avian Influenza clearly underscore the threat and seriousness of global diseases. The steadily growing globalization makes it difficult to contain pandemics to a certain region. Therefore, pandemic control is of highest importance to human health. Unfortunately, the segmented nature of the genome of influenza viruses is very conducive for genetic shifts and their rapid spread across various genera augments genetic drift. For example, the human influenza pandemics in 1957 and 1968 were suggested to have been caused by reassorted influenza viruses [1] . Moreover, the H5N1 outbreak in Hong Kong in 1997 has convincingly demonstrated the ability of an avian virus to make the transition from birds to humans directly without going through a perceived \"permissible host\". In particular, the H5N1 virus is believed to have acquired the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 H5N1 and A/teal/ Hong Kong/W312/97 H6N1, while the internal genes were received from A/quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 H2N2 or A/teal/Hong Kong/W312/97 H6N1, respectively [2] , [3] . Even though this particular strain was eliminated by culling millions of chicken, its ancestors remains circulating in aquatic birds. This paper proposes a new approach to pandemic control by constantly monitoring molecular evolution at both macro level (within the group of viruses) and micro level (within the group of strains) using comparative phyloinformatics. This can facilitate prediction of how these viruses are evolving in terms of spatial, temporal, and host dimensions, and therefore, allows for faster responses to new outbreaks as well as their diagnosis. However, corresponding phylogenetic tree construction algorithms suffer from long runtimes due to their high degrees of computational complexity as well as the large datasets involved. Therefore, it is necessary to develop informatics based solutions that use suitable algorithms and take advantage of distributed computing technologies to make such studies feasible in a reasonable amount of time. Furthermore, these solutions need to be integrated in a framework for pandemic control that is biologist-friendly. As a result, effective vaccines and antivirals can be designed more easily and within a shorter response time, since specific local strains can be targeted directly.",
