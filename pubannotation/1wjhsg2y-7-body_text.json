    "text": "While bat conservation efforts and emerging disease surveillance have the potential to be contradictory when not well designed, they are actually aligned by shared human threats that lead to both bat extinction and zoonotic disease emergence. For example, hunting of bats for bushmeat, a major threat to Old World fruit bats [56, 64] , is a high risk activity that puts hunters and butchers in direct contact with blood and excreta and increases the risk of viral spillover from bats [65, 66] . Direct persecution of bats and attempts at population eradication (e.g., the recent culling of bats in Mauritius [67, 68] ) may have countereffects by actually increasing viral prevalence in the bat population [69] , and also increasing the opportunities for viral spillover through direct contact with bats during culling [12, 69, 70] . Similarly, the loss of bat habitat through land conversion for agricultural and livestock production and development, the primary threat to bats globally [3, 71] , is a major risk factor for zoonotic disease emergence [22] . Clearing of forested habitats, specifically for agricultural crops (e.g., fruit orchards), leads to the direct destruction of roosting and foraging sites, and therefore displaces bat populations. It also creates a direct interface between frugivorous bats and humans or livestock that can mediate viral species jumps (e.g., Old World fruit bats and Nipah virus in Malaysia and Bangladesh) [72] [73] [74] . Cave disturbance, such as resource extraction (guano or mineral mining), hunting, and ecotourism, is a major threat to bat populations [75] , especially for species less tolerant to human disturbance [76] , but can also lead to increased contact between bats and humans that may facilitate viral spillover. For example, 7 of 13 cases of Marburg virus spillover to humans have been linked to gold mining activities, and other isolated cases have been linked to ecotourism in caves occupied by Rousettus aegyptiacus [77] .",
