    "text": "Southern blot hybridization was used to confirm integration and determine the copy number of the 3D8 scFv gene in the transgenic mice. Genomic DNA (20 mg) from each transformant was digested with EcoRI and HindIII restriction enzymes and then the DNA was separated on 1% agarose gels. 3D8 scFv-specific [ 32 P]-radiolabeled probes were prepared from the pcDNA3.1V5/HisB-3D8 scFv vector.",
