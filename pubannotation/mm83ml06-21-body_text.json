    "text": "To further analyze the potential antiretroviral activity of the DIs PR-619 and P22077, HLAC [62] , prepared from human tonsil tissue, were infected with HIV-1NL4-3. HLA cultures reflect the natural cell population of a lymphoid tissue and support productive HIV-1 replication independently of coreceptor tropism and without exogenous stimulation [52, 53] . The cells were infected with either T-cell (X4)-or macrophage (R5)-tropic HIV-1NL4-3 standardized for equal amounts of p24. Following permanent (up to 15 days post infection) or structured treatment (only day 1 and 3 post infection) with increasing concentrations of the DIs PR-619 or P22077, cell culture supernatants were collected on the indicated days post infection (dpi) and analyzed for release of virus particles by measuring the virus associated reverse transcriptase (RT) activity ( Figure 4A ).",
