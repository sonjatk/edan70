    "text": "Strong cation exchange chromatography (SCX). SCX was performed to remove excess iTRAQ reagents and interfering substances for the mass analysis. The labeled peptides were then dried in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 200 ml Buffer A, prior to being loaded on a Phenomenex Luna 55 µm SCX 100A column [250x4.60 mm (length x internal diameter), 5 µm; Phenomenex, Inc., Torrance, CA, USA] on an Agilent 1100 HPLC unit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Buffer A consisted of 10 mM KH 2 PO 4 and 25% acetonitrile at pH 3.0, while Buffer B consisted of 10 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 25% acetonitrile and 2 M KCl at pH 3.0. The 60 min gradient comprised 100% Buffer A for 30 min, 0-5% Buffer B for 1 min, 5-30% Buffer B for 15 min, 30-50% Buffer B for 5 min, 50% Buffer B for 4 min and 50-100% Buffer A for Table II . Clinical characteristics of the nine serum samples for western blotting verification. 5 min. Thirteen fractions were collected using a Foxy JR Fraction Collector (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Fractions 2 and 3 were pooled according to the chromatogram profile, based on the peak intensity. All fractions were then dried in a vacuum concentrator and stored at -20˚C, prior to further analysis using mass spectrometry.",
