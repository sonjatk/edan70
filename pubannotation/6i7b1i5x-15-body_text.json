    "text": "Antibodies J and A were created from non-native pairing of the most prevalent sequences from reported plasma cell infiltrates (3 repeats of heavy chain and duplicates of light chains) [101, 104] . On binding bronchial epithelium specimens from children with KD, antibodies J and A identified intracellular inclusions (ICI) [51, 57] . In a subsequent study, 26% of the control group, composed primarily of adult patients, had similar inclusion bodies that were bound by antibody J [105] . Although many viruses can reactivate during stress (Herpesviridae family) or are considered 'slow' viral infections [106] , the failure of numerous attempts to identify a specific infectious agent argues against such a persistent infection [57] . There remains the possibility that this is a difficult to culture virus, such as coronavirus, which had also enjoyed a short-lived consideration as the cause of KD [107] .",
