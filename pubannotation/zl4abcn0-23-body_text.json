    "text": "The present HPLC-UV method had a lower LOQ compared to previous methods reported on analysis of lycorine, which were in the range of 1-34 g/mL [2, 7, 14] . The lower sensitivity of the present method permits the quantification of minute amount of lycorine present in the ex vivo plant tissues as well as the callus culture samples.",
