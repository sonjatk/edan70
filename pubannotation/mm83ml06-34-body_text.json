    "text": "There are mainly two possible explanations for the synergistic effect of DIs and proteasome inhibitors: First, the amount of free ubiquitin is significantly reduced by the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins and the lack of recycling of polyubiquitin chains. This might interfere with the function of the ESCRT-complex as early acting ESCRT factors like ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, and ALG-2 interacting protein X (ALIX) possess ubiquitin binding domains, and thus ubiquitin may play an important role in their substrate recognition [90] [91] [92] [93] . Second, the addition of DIs together with proteasome inhibitors might lead to the accumulation of so-called defective ribosomal products (DRiPs). DRiPs are de novo synthesized erroneous proteins, which are rapidly degraded via the UPS. Originally, it was shown that the HIV-1 Gag protein is a bona fide substrate for the DRiP-pathway [94] and proteasome inhibitors lead to an accumulation of DRiPs [38] . Combinatory treatment of cells with DIs might lead to a further enhancement of accumulated Gag-DRiPs within the cell. Thereby, those Gag-DRiPs interfere with virus release by disturbing the highly ordered assembly of Gag molecules in a prion-like manner [38] .",
