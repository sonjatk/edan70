    "text": "To determine whether our protease-mutant viruses differed significantly from our wildtype virus, we characterized fitness and replication characteristics. As shown in Figure 2A , the wildtype and mutant viruses replicate with similar kinetics. To ascertain whether these viruses produced similar levels of infectious particles, we measured the ratio of viral genomes to infectious virus. Vero cells were infected with the wildtype or protease mutant viruses for 48 h, and subsequently, viral titers ( Figure 3A ) were determined by plaque assay and RNA was processed from infected cellular supernatant. The number of viral genomes was quantified by qRT-PCR ( Figure 3B) , and the ratio of genomes to infectious virus (pfu) calculated ( Figure 3C ). We observed no changes in viral titers in polyamine-sufficient conditions, and viral genomes were slightly elevated, though not statistically significant, in 2A 29K and 3C 52R mutant viruses ( Figure 3B) . Overall, the genome-to-pfu ratio was not statistically significantly different among our protease mutant viruses.",
