    "text": "\"Practitioners come together to share best practices, through the ID networks, through the hospital networks, through the volunteer networks, you know, build communities of practice until this becomes a culture. And people are learning from each other ( . . . ) But whether it gets done is a question of culture, a culture needs strategy every day ( . . . ) so you want to do change, and you want to do large scale change and you want to sustain the change you need to create a movement not a directive . . . I think it's more important to you to create the social movement around what that is, because if you are going to achieve this style change of behavior you need a more behavioral approach to this problem not a clinical approach.\" -I05, Human Health",
