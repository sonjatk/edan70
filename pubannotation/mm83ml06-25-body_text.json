    "text": "By blocking the deubiquitination of Gag, the DIs P22077 and PR-619 should also increase steady state levels of poly-ubiquitinated Gag and thus its entry into the UPS. To address this issue, HeLa cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) and syngag expression plasmids, and treated for 12 h with indicated concentrations of DIs. The ∆PTAP mutant, which was shown to display elevated levels of ubiquitinated Gag, was assessed in parallel [25, 30] . To avoid rapid proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitinated Gag species following DI treatment, cells were incubated with the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and Lactacystin (LC) 4 h prior to cell lysis. After immunoprecipitation with Gag-specific antibodies, western blot analyses were performed and ubiquitinated Gag species were detected by anti-HA staining (Figure 8 ). Following co-expression of syngag wt and HA-Ub, a faint pattern of high molecular weight species was observed, which most likely represents polyubiquitinated Gag. Upon treatment with 14 µM PR-619 or 20 µM P22077, the intensity of the HA-Ub-signal was clearly increased and exceeded even the ubiquitination-levels of the ∆PTAP mutant. Similar amounts of precipitated Gag were confirmed by anti-CA staining. Thus, treatment with P22077 or PR-619 enhances polyubiquitination of Gag. ",
