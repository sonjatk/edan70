    "text": "The human PDK1 promoter ligated to the luciferase reporter gene were a gift from Drs. Michalik and Desvergne (Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland) and have been reported previously [17] . The PDK1 promoter construct contains ∼ 663 bp of the human PDK1 promoter connected to the pGL 2 vector. Briefly, normal bronchial epithelial cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 10 5 per well in 24-well dishes and grown to 50-60 % confluence. For each well, 0.4 μg of the above PDK1 plasmid DNA constructs, with or without 0.5 μg of the internal control phRL-TK Synthetic Renilla Luciferase Reporter Vector, were co-transfected into the cells using lipofectamine 2000 reagent . After 24 h of incubation, cells were treated with or without dmPGE 2 for 4 h. The preparation of cell extracts and measurement of luciferase activities were carried out using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter kit according to recommendations by the manufacturer (Promega). The assays for firefly luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity were performed sequentially in a Labsystems Luminoskan Ascent luminometer equipped with dual injectors. Changes in firefly luciferase activity were calculated and plotted after normalization with changes in Renilla luciferase activity within the same sample.",
