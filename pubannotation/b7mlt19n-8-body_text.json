    "text": "The iLIR web resource can make the distinction between xLIR and WxxL patterns. 27, 28 We noticed that a vast majority of the motifs identified in viral proteins correspond to the WxxL pattern ( Fig. 2B and Table S1 ). The identification of putative LIR motifs has been done for all the reviewed sequences for viral proteins. Among the sequences sorted as putative LIR-containing proteins, 1517 sequences belong to 188 species of bacteriophages (Table S2 ). However, it is likely that these sequences correspond to false-positive hits as bacteria don't have an autophagy process. Using a hypergeometric test (see supplementary information), we compared the enrichment fold of proteins containing LIR motifs (LIRCPs) in bacteriophages with viruses infecting eukaryotes. We noticed that the enrichment fold for both xLIR and WxxL patterns in LIRCPs was higher in viruses infecting eukaryotes than in bacteriophages (Table S2) which is in line with the fact that autophagy has been reported only in eukaryotes.",
