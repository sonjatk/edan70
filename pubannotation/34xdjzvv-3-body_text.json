    "text": "Anti-EV71 viral drugs and vaccine are being developed, but their protective efficacy could not be efficiently evaluated due to lack of proper animal model. Several animal models have been developed to be EV71 infectious model using the mouse-adapted strain of EV71 [5] , innate immunodeficient mice [6] , or monkey models [7] . The intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of clinical isolate of EV71 to adult mice caused no apparent clinical symptoms. Administration of mouse-adapted EV71 strain 4643 (Tainan/ 4643/98) to 1-d-old ICR mice caused hind limb paralysis (LP) and death within 2 wk of the challenge [8] . Challenge of 1-d-old BALB/C and ICR mice infected with EV71 YN3 strain was also lethal [5] . A deficiency in type I and type II IFN receptors of the AG129 mouse cause neurological manifestations after infection with the non-mouse adapted EV71 strain (5865/SIN/00009; [6] ). The EV71 BrCr strain, an original prototype of the genotype A strain from California [9] , was demonstrated to induce neurological manifestations of tremor, ataxia, and brain edema, but no pulmonary edema (PE) and cardiac failure in cynomolgus monkeys [7] . These models are not perfect for HFMD or for neuropathogenesis caused by EV71. Viral pathogenesis in mouseadapted EV71-infected newborn suckling mice dose not mimic human infection and exhibit the restricted timeframe (up to one week old of mouse age) allowing for pathogenic challenge of EV71. In addition, innate immunity, particularly type I IFN, involved for the EV71-induced pathogenic phenotype was reported [10, 11] .",
