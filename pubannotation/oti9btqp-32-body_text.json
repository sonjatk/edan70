    "text": "The PRNT involving MR766 and Vero cells was described previously. 28 Briefly, heat-inactivated mouse or RM sera were serially diluted in serumfree DMEM (1:10 to 1: 1280) and incubated with an equal volume of ZIKV MR766 (100 PFU) at 37°C for 2 h. The mixtures were added to the confluent layers of Vero cells and left at 37°C for adsorption for 2 h. A 2 × DMEM media:soft-agar (1:1) overlay was added over cells and the plate was incubated for 5 days at 37°C. The agar overlay was removed and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with 1 × PBS, stained with crystal violet solution, washed with 1 × PBS and the plates were left to dry. The plaques in assays done in 24-well plates were scanned with an automated Immunospot reader (CTL Limited), and the plaques in sample wells and in negative control (DMEM only) and positive control (100 PFU MR766 ZIKV virus only) wells were counted using the automated software provided with the ELISpot reader. The percentage plaque reduction was calculated as follows: % reduction = 100 × {1 − (average number of plaques for each dilution/average number of plaques in positive control wells)}. GraphPad Prism software was used to perform nonlinear regression analysis of % plaque reduction versus a log transformation of each individual serum dilution to facilitate linear interpolation of actual 50% PRNT titres at peak post vaccination response. The medians and interquartile ranges at 50% neutralisation were calculated for each neutralisation target overall and by vaccine treatment group; the geometric mean titres were also calculated. The titres represent the reciprocal of the highest dilution resulting in a 50% reduction in the number of plaques.",
