    "text": "Coimmunoprecipitation assay of cell lysate expressing both ORF2 and myc tagged full-length βTRCP revealed that ORF2 could efficiently associate with the latter ( Figure 4A, upper panel, lane 2) . Exposure of the same blot to X-ray film revealed the band specific to ORF2 in βTRCP and ORF2 cotransfected cells ( Figure 4A , lower panel, lane 2). 3 rd lane in upper panel shows the expression of the βTRCP protein, as judged by immunoprecipitation using anti-myc antibody. Specificity of the above interaction was further verified by checking for association of ORF2 with another F-box protein, SKP2. We were unable to detect any interaction between ORF2 and SKP2 as judged by coimmunoprecipitation assay ( Figure 4B, top panel) . In order to ensure that SKP2 was indeed functional in these experiments, the same blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-myc antibody. Endogenous SKP2 was able to coprecipitate endogenous as well as overexpressed c-myc protein ( Figure 4B , middle panel) and similarly IP using myc antibody revealed its interaction with the SKP2 protein ( Figure 4B transfected cells were labeled with [ 35 S]-cys/met promix and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-IκBα antibody, pre-immune serum (PS) or anti-ORF2 antibodies, respectively; subsequently, samples were immunoblotted with SKP1 and CUL1 antibodies. Same blot was air dried and exposed to X-ray film to check for ORF2 expression by autoradiography.",
