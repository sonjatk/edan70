    "text": "Numerous studies now indicate that polymorphisms in genes encoding the cardiac transcription factors NKX2-5 and PITX2C increase susceptibility to atrial fibrillation (Huang et al. 2013; Qiu et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2014; Xie et al. 2013) , suggesting the potential involvement of disrupted gene networks in this disorder. Both factors are required for development of the pulmonary myocardium (Mommersteeg et al. 2007; Ye et al. 2015) , which is also thought to have a pathological role in atrial fibrillation (Chen et al. 1999) . A large body of literature has also been amassed to show that variants in genes regulating calcium handling lead to arrhythmia (Table 6 ). However, how the pulmonary myocardium gains pacemaker activity in atrial fibrillation patients is still unknown. Further, the underlying molecular identity of the pulmonary myocardium, including which ion channels and transcription factors are expressed in this tissue, has not been described in detail. We have used a systems-genetics approach to examine a large network of coexpressed genes simultaneously without prior knowledge of their identity, and have attempted to shed light on the relationships between transcriptional regulation, ion/calcium handling, contractile phenotypes, and the gene networks involved. By correlating variation in gene expression and known BXD genotypes in a genome-wide eQTL analysis we identified three regulatory loci associated with the expression of a cardiac gene network in the pulmonary myocardium.",
