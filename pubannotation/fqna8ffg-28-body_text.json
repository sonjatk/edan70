    "text": "In our study, the inflammatory activation of the epithelium showed a transient nature and resolved rapidly, in a way that Cxcl5 gene expression declined by a factor of 20 from 12 h to 24 h after CNP treatment (Fig. 4b) . The time-course of maximal epithelial inflammatory activation from 6 to 12 h after CNP suggests that the alveolar epithelium gets stimulated by the deposited particles only for a short period of time and then recovers to basal conditions. One reason explaining this dynamic inflammatory kinetic could be related to the rapid phagocytic particle clearance by resident AM, as no increase in the percentage of particle laden cells is observed 12 h after IT. In fact our data suggests that the pulmonary deposited CNPs can only develop their pro-inflammatory potency on the epithelium until engulfed by macrophages. From that point on the epithelial irritation can recover since CNP laden AMs do obviously not promote inflammation but rather remain inactive until eventually cleared by mucociliary removal. In vitro exposure of ATII cells to high doses carbon black nanoparticles has previously been shown to stimulate the release of macrophage chemoattractants [68] , suggesting that structural cells might trigger the chemotaxis of AMs to the site of particle deposition. In this light the outdated term \"dust cells\" for alveolar macrophages highlights their specification in a way that for 'low-solubility low-toxicity particles' the essential function of AMs is limited to the removal of particles from the lining fluid to prevent epithelial irritation and inflammation, but not to trigger inflammation itself.",
