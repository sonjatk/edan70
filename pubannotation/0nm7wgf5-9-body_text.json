    "text": "We postinfection (for a time of addition of 24 h). The addition of inhibitors was inhibitory up to 12 h postinfection, whereas at 24 h postinfection, it had no effect (Fig. 5a) . At 24 h postinfection, we expect later stages of the viral life cycle, namely, viral genome packaging, assembly, and egress, to be active compared to viral RNA replication; therefore, inhibitors that block viral RNA replication would have no effect at these stages of viral infection. Together, these data clearly suggest that all three inhibitors block early stages of the viral life cycle and are not able to prevent virus infection once the virus enters postreplicative stages of infection.",
