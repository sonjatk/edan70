    "text": "The detection of the negative-sense strand RNA was used as a token of DWV replication [48, 49] . First, the negative-sense strand RNA was tagged and then amplified: The cDNA of all T1 and T2 colonies sampled at Week 13 and 16 were obtained by using Superscript ® III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's recommendations (1 µL of DWV 3F tagged primer, Table 1 , 1 µL dNTP 10 mM, 4 µL of 5× first strand buffer, 2 µL 0.1 M DTT, 1 µL M-MLV reverse transcriptase, H 2 O and sample in a final reaction volume of 20 µL) [52] . The reaction was processed in a thermocycler (Biometra; Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany) according to the following protocol: 5 min at 65 • C, 10 min at 25 • C, 60 min at 50 • C followed by 15 min at 70 • C. The obtained cDNA then was purified using the NucleoSpin ® Gel & PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel) and eluted in 30 µL elution buffer to avoid false-positive results. A five-fold dilution of the purified cDNA was used for the subsequent amplification with conventional PCR (MyTay™ kit by Bioline, London, UK). DWV-R1 was used as the reverse primer, while a Tag oligonucleotide (Table 1 ) was used as forward primer. For each sample, a second reaction was carried out without forward primer to check for efficient removal of DWV 3F tagged primer after the reverse transcription. The thermal cycling was done with a profile that consisted of 2 min incubation at 95 • C and 35 cycles of 20 s at 95 • C for denaturation, 20 s at 42 • C for annealing, and 30 s at 72 • C for extension. By electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel, the PCR products were analyzed and visually checked under UV light. If a clear band was present at 221 bp and the associated negative control was indeed negative, a sample was considered positive.",
