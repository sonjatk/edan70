    "text": "The identification of highly pathogenic MERS-CoV suggests that coronaviruses present an incessant and long-term hazard to humans. Development of effective therapeutic and prophylactic agents to contain their infections is an urgent need, and yet currently no antiviral treatments against MERS-CoV are available. MERS-CoV is known to interact with host cell surface receptor DPP4 or CD26 with its spike S protein, which subsequently leads to its entry in the host cell [61] . Our knowledge regarding the exact mechanisms that follow thereafter is still limited and requires more research. Due to lack of definite treatment, supportive therapy remains the only solution. Present development consists of the previous experiences of other coronavirus diseases like SARS-CoV, which have been studied in in vitro and in vivo models. Tremendous efforts are being made in this direction and various antiviral and related therapies have been identified. Use of humanized monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma and therapeutic peptides has been shown efficacious. Repurposing of the currently available drugs is also being tried to extend their efficacy against MERS-CoV. Some potential options are discussed in detail below.",
