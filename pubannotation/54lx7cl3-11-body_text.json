    "text": "The crucial role these various mechanisms play in determining respiratory disease is demonstrated by contrasting M. catarrhalis with S. pneumoniae. Similar to S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis is a primary carriage species estimated to colonize between 31% and 50% of children <2 years in the USA [45] and frequently causes URT infections, such as acute otitis media. However, unlike S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis rarely causes pneumonia [46] , suggesting that differences in mechanisms of pathogenicity may be the explanation.",
