    "text": "One-way ANOVA with the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare the results obtained from different groups with HLS or paralysis symptoms. An unpaired student t test with Welch correction was used to evaluate the statistical differences of the RNA expression levels between the groups. The log-rank test was used to evaluate differences in survival. A p-value ,0.05 was considered statistically significant. The symbol * and ** were used to indicate p-values ,0.05 and ,0.01, respectively. These tests were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows.",
