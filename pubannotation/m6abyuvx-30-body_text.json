    "text": "Interestingly, immunization with rVV-N25 rapidly suppressed the inflammatory response; however, immunization with either of the other rVVs did not (see Figure 6A ). This result indicated that rVV-N25 may modulate inflammation via innate immunity, as well as via acquired immunity. Reportedly, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent recognition pathways play a role in the recognition of poxviruses [27] . TLR2 and TLR9 have also been implicated in the recognition of the vaccinia virus [28, 29] . These findings indicate that TLR on dendritic cells may modulate the immunosuppressive effect of rVV-N25 in our model of HCV infection; however, further examination of this hypothesis is required. The finding that pathological symptoms in the HCV transgenic mice were completely blocked by intravenous injection of TNF-a and IL-6 neutralizing antibodies indicated that the progression of chronic hepatitis depended on inflammatory cytokines in serum, rather than the HCV protein levels in hepatocytes. Lymphocytes, macrophages, hepatocytes, and adipocytes each produce TNF-a and IL-6 [30, 31] , and HCV-infected patients have elevated levels of TNF-a and IL-6 [32, 33] . Both cytokines also contribute to the maintenance of hepatosteatosis in mice fed a high-fat diet [34] , and production of TNF-a and IL-6 is elevated in obese mice due to the low grade inflammatory response that is caused by lipid accumulation [35] . These findings indicate that both cytokines are responsible for HCV-triggered hepatosteatosis, and anti-cytokine neutralization is a potential treatment for chronic hepatitis if antiviral therapy is not successful.",
