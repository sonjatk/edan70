    "text": "The SEED provides the ability to graphically display the chromosomal regions around a set of genes (normally from distinct genomes); for example, see http://seed-viewer.theseed.org/ seedviewer.cgi?page=Annotation&feature=fig|83333.1.peg.4. The SEED also offers an alternative for creating custom interfaces, moreover, one that does not require the user to know appropriate SEED IDs. This approach exploits the conversion capabilities of the SEED for creating a program to accept arbitrary protein IDs. It also exploits the ability of SEED to map functional roles into subsystems as described in the preceding example. The result is a tool that enables the user to take a SEED ID and a region size, and extract the genes that are found within a region centered on the designated gene. The code for this example is shown at. http://servers.theseed.org/ sapling/server.cgi?code=server_paper_example3.pl (also provided as Supporting Information S1).",
