During lunch time we sit in a small room within the TB wards, which accommodates less than five people and the door doesn't even close.\" Nurse (N4) said: \"all patients are accommodated in the same wards, whether they are extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) or MRD or TB patients, hmmm the wards layout is not proper. We have to sit all day with patients and told that patients who are under treatment are not infectious (emotional).\"",
