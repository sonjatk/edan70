    "text": "Finally, we evaluated whether rVV-N25 treatment affected the number of macrophages, cytokine production by macrophages, or both; specifically, we isolated IHLs from CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice 7 days after immunization with rVV-N25 or with LC16m8. The percentage of macrophages (CD11b + F4/80 + ) among IHLs and IL-6 production from these macrophages were significantly lower in rVV-N25-treated mice than in control mice ( Figure 6G ). Though the percentage of TNF-a-producing macrophages was not significantly different in rVV-N25-treated and control mice (P = 0.099), rVV-N25 treatment appeared to suppress these macrophages. These results demonstrated that rVV-N25 had a suppressive effect on activated macrophages, and they indicated that this suppression ameliorated the histological indicators of chronic hepatitis.",
