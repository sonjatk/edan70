    "text": "Ganguly et a l. studied the tissue distribution and clearance of 125 I-labeled PNA TAR and its penetratin and tat conjugates [101] . They reported the distribution of the conjugates throughout the mouse major internal organs when administered by oral route as well as their slow release and clearance from different organs. Surprisingly, unconjugated naked PNA TAR displayed a similar tissue distribution and clearance profile although the extent of its uptake was lower than its CPP conjugate. In vi vo antiviral activity of PNA TAR and its penetratin and tat conjugates needs to be assessed.",
