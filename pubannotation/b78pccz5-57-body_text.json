    "text": "The first exposure reduction scenario is defined as finding the health-based optimum ventilation rate without any other actions that change indoor or outdoor sources. In this scenario the pollutant concentrations from indoor and outdoor sources compete so that pollutants from indoor sources are decreasing and pollutants from the outdoor sources are increasing when the ventilation rate is increased. The health-based -10 -optimum level of ventilation is solved for each country among EU-26 by calculating burden of disease with ventilation rates from 0.1 to 50 lps pp.",
