    "text": "Recently, we identified a novel, highly efficient −2/−1 PRF event that functions without a recognizable stimulatory RNA secondary structure (18, 19) . This signal operates during translation of the genome of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), a member of the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales (20) . The PRRSV genome (Figure 1 ), a positive-sense RNA molecule some 15 kb in length, harbours two PRF signals. A 'canonical' −1 PRF element, including a stimulatory RNA pseudo- The ∼15-kb PRRSV genome has two long 5 ORFs, 1a and 1b encoding non-structural polyproteins (nsps) and at least eight shorter 3 ORFs (2a-7) encoding structural proteins. ORF1a and ORF1b are translated from the genomic RNA, with translation of ORF1b depending on −1 PRF at the end of ORF1a. The TF ORF overlaps the central ORF1a region in the −2 reading frame and is accessed via −2 PRF (18) . A −1 frameshift at the same site generates the nsp2N product. Shown below is the sequence of the SD01-08 RNA in the region of the −2/−1 PRF signal, with the slippery sequence (purple) and C-rich motif (red) highlighted. The −1 reading frame stop codon is underlined and codons for each of the reading frames are indicated. (B) Crystal structure of the PRRSV nsp1␤ dimer (32) . The putative RNA binding domain is in orange (see text). (C) RNAs derived from FspI-cut pDluc PRRSV/wt, or a variant with the −1 frame stop codon (panel A) changed to UUA (PRRSV/stop), were translated in RRL in the presence of the indicated concentrations of His-tagged nsp1␤ (M) or with nsp1␤ dilution buffer (DB). The products were resolved by 12% sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and visualized by autoradiography. 14 C molecular size markers were also run on the gel (M). Products generated by ribosomes that do not frameshift (stop) or that enter the −1 or −2 frames are indicated. The asterisk indicates the −1 PRF product of the PRRSV/wt construct. (D) In vitro translation of pDluc PRRSV/wt mRNA in the presence of 1 M GST-nsp1␤ or mutant derivatives (PR, RBM; see text). Control translations were supplemented with an equivalent concentration of expressed GST or DB alone. Translation products were analysed and quantified as above (C). knot structure, is located at the junction of the overlapping replicase-encoding ORFs 1a and 1b and facilitates expression of an ORF1a-ORF1b fusion product. The second signal, which stimulates both −2 PRF and −1 PRF, is located within the region of ORF1a that encodes a large, multifunctional replicase subunit, non-structural protein 2 (nsp2). Here, about 20% of ribosomes translating nsp2 frameshift into the −2 reading frame to generate a transframe fusion protein (nsp2TF) comprising the N-terminal two-thirds of nsp2 and a C-terminus derived from a conserved, overlap-ping ORF (transframe; TF) in the −2 reading frame. A further 7% of ribosomes shift into the −1 reading frame where they immediately encounter a stop codon resulting in the synthesis of a truncated version of nsp2 termed nsp2N (19) . As shown in Figure 1A , the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence (GG GUU UUU) used for −2/−1 PRF in PRRSV does not harbour an obvious secondary structure compatible with canonical RNA-structure-stimulated PRF. However, mutations within a conserved CCCANCUCC motif located 11 nt downstream of the shift site reduce or Nucleic Acids Research, 2016, Vol. 44, No. 12 5493 inhibit frameshifting, consistent with the presence of a 3 stimulatory element of some form (18) . A further novelty of the PRRSV −2/−1 PRF signal is an essential role for the 25-kDa viral replicase subunit nsp1␤, which functions as a trans-activator of both −2 and −1 PRF ( Figure 1B) (19) . Nsp1␤ is one of the 14 subunits produced from the PRRSV replicase polyproteins. How it acts in PRF is unclear but replacement of basic residues within a highly conserved putative RNA-binding motif located in the papain-like autoproteinase (PLP) domain of nsp1␤ have a detrimental effect on frameshifting (19) .",
