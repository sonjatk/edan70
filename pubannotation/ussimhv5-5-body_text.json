    "text": "Our data herein suggest that HN-ZZ1 is a novel recombinant parvovirus between CPV and FPLV, and the recombinant virus Figure 1 The results of the phylogenetic analysis of the VP2 and NS1 genes from the HN-ZZ1 strain and the deduced amino-acid sequence characterization. (A) Phylogenetic trees were inferred for the nucleotides of the VP2 and NS1 genes. The trees were generated by the neighbor-joining method with bootstrap tests of 1000 replicates using the MEGA 6.05 software. The HN-ZZ1 strain isolated in the current study is indicated (â€¢). The GenBank accession numbers of the sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 1. (B) Amino-acid sequence characterization of the NS1 and VP2 proteins from the HN-ZZ1 strain. might be epidemic in China. If this virus is epidemic, it will place wild and captive animals at increased risk. Although the role of this recombination event between CPV and FPLV in viral pathogenicity is unknown, our preliminary infection studies confirmed the high virulence of this recombinant virus. The intranasal infection studies in six 3-month-old cats with the HN-ZZ1 isolate resulted in anorexia, vomiting and fever in the affected animals at 2day post infection. Subsequently, the cats began to display severe vomiting and developed watery to hemorrhagic diarrhea, which resulted in nearly 100% mortality in affected cats at 4-6 days post infection. Gross examinations showed that the affected cats were characterized by mild to severe fibrinous to fibrinomucoid enteritis with thickened mucosa, with bleeding spots on the surface of the heart, liver, lungs and spleen (data not shown). At present, the number of strains from Zoo animals that have been characterized by molecular methods are very limited, as can be observed by the scarce complete VP2 sequences available in GenBank. With the emergence and continuous increase of recombinant parvoviruses, our ongoing studies will investigate the geographic distribution of these viruses, monitor their recombination characteristics, identify their virulence determinants by reverse genetics and develop efficient strategies against these novel viruses.",
