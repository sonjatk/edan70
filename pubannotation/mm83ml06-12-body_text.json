    "text": "HeLa TZM-bl indicator cells were seeded in 96-well plates in duplicates (4000 cells/well) and infected the next day with 1 ng vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped virions standardized for p24 content by ELISA (Aalto Bio Reagents). After overnight incubation, fresh medium was added. 48 h later, cells were washed with PBS and infection was detected using the Gal-Screen chemiluminescent reporter gene assay system (Applied Biosystems, Waltham, MA, USA). Î²-Galactosidase activity was quantified as relative light units per second using a Synergy HT microplate reader and Gen5 Data Analysis Software (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).",
