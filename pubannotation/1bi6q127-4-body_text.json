    "text": "One must be cautious when interpreting the literature on bat defenses. The order Chiroptera contains more than 1200 species [17] . Due to this diversity, the information obtained from one species may not apply to others. For instance, in the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto), the interferon gene locus is contracted, whereas in the Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus), this locus is expanded [18, 19] . Other examples are discussed later in this review.",
