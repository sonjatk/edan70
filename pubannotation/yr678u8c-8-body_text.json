    "text": "The presence of DMVs in coronavirus infected cells suggested that this group of viruses might, like other positive sense RNA viruses, utilise the autophagy pathway to generate the membrane structures required for replication. Initial work showed that MHV infection induced autophagy [50] . Nsp8 co-localised with LC3 throughout infection and the nucleocapsid protein N co-localised with LC3 early in infection, but this decreased over time. In addition, MHV replication was markedly reduced in ATG5 −/− embryonic stem cell lines but virus titre was rescued in the presence of an ATG5 expressing plasmid [50] . Further work using SARS-CoV again showed co-localisation between nsp8 and LC3 [51] . However, work by others using bone marrow derived macrophages lacking ATG5 or ATG5 −/− primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), showed that MHV replication does not require either an intact autophagy pathway or conversion of LC3I to LC3II. They did however confirm that SARS-CoV nsps co-localised with LC3 [52] . Recently, Schneider et al. demonstrated that SARS-CoV replication could also occur in ATG5 −/− MEFs, indicating no requirement for a complete autophagy pathway [53] . Interestingly, it was observed that virus replication was unaffected by the induction of autophagy in wild type MEFs [53] . Finally, de Haan et al. were unable to show co-localisation between MHV nsp8 and GFP-LC3 [54] , and Snijder et al. were unable to show co-localisation between SARS-CoV nsp3 and either endogenous LC3 or GFP-LC3A, GFP-LC3B or GFP-LC3C [9] . Despite the lack of clarity with regard to the requirement for autophagy during coronavirus infection, all studies did indicate that LC3 became punctate upon coronavirus infection, suggesting an induction of autophagy [9, [50] [51] [52] 54] .",
