    "text": "The impact of both antibody and low pH suggested FcRn involvement [34, 35] . We knocked down FcRn in HEC-1A cells, verifying lower expression by flow cytometry and by Western blot ( Figure S3A ). The knock-down HEC-1A cells attained the same level of electrical resistance as did the wild-type cells (data not shown), indicating that FcRn knockdown did not affect the ability to form tight junctions. Unlike with wild-type HEC-1A cells, there was no enhanced transcytosis with FcRn-knockdown HEC-1A cells when either mAb 2F5 (Figure 2A ) or polyclonal HIVIG (data not shown) were used. We also evaluated Fc mutants of the HIV-1 Env-specific mAb b12. A mutant designed to abrogate FcRn binding (I253A), markedly lowered transcytosis compared with wild-type b12 ( Figure 2B ) [36] . The second mutant (M428L), designed to bind with higher affinity to FcRn, increased transcytosis compared with wild-type b12 ( Figure 2B ) [37] . Binding to HIV-1 JRFL gp120 ( Figure S3B ) and neutralization of HIV-1 JRFL ( Figure S3C ) were nearly equivalent for the wild-type and Fc mutant versions of b12, indicating that the Fc mutations did not affect Fab-antigen binding.
