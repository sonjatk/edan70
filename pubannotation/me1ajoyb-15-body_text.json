    "text": "Much of the work examining reservoir responses to hantaviruses has been conducted in rats infected with SEOV and deer mice infected with SNV or ANDV. Using cDNA arrays, Klein et al. [77] identified nearly 2000 genes that were differentially expressed in male and female rats infected with SEOV. Many immune-associated transcription factors, proinflammatory, antiviral, T cell and Ig family member genes were significantly higher in females, which may reduce transmission from females.",
