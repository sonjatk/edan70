    "text": "Nevertheless, the immunogenicity of N requires further characterization in preclinical models for MERS-CoV infection. In addition to the induction of MERS-CoV-specific antibodies, the MERS-CoV N protein holds promise to efficiently activate virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses. For more detailed studies characterizing the possible role of these T cell specificities in MERS-CoV-associated immunity or pathogenesis it is highly relevant to determine the N peptide epitopes allowing for the appropriate MHC-restricted antigen presentation and the activation of virus-specific T cells. In this study, we identified a new H2-d restricted CD8+ T cell epitope in the MERS-CoV N protein using a 2-D matrix and pools of 84 overlapping 15-mer N peptides. First, we have identified two MERS-CoV N derived peptides (N 353-367 = QNIDAYKTFPKKEKK and N 357-371 = AYKTFPKKEKKQKAP) and further mapped these 15-mer peptides to the minimal aa sequence of N 358-367 = YKTFPKKEKK representing a decamer peptide epitope ( Figure S1 ) [64] . Analysis of MERS-CoV sequences reveals that N 358-367 is conserved among different strains of MERS-CoV (Table S2 ) [65] . The availability of such an epitope may allow for more detailed experimental monitoring of cellular immune responses induced by a MVA based candidate vaccine against MERS-CoV in the mouse model and potentially also in other preclinical models. Of note, the H2-d restricted CD8+ T cell epitope enables characterization of T cell responses in BALB/c mice that serve as a well-established MERS-CoV infection model following adenovirus vector mediated transduction with hDPP4 [24, 40, 41, 43, 44] . A particular feature of MERS in humans, as observed upon the investigation of cluster outbreaks in hospitals, is the lack of detectable MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies in patients with confirmed disease [66, 67] . This observation is attributed to the emergence of specific virus mutants evading the neutralizing antibody response, as already described for SARS-CoV [68, 69] . Thus, future use of a T cell-specific immune monitoring might contribute to a more detailed understanding of MERS pathogenesis. Here, studies on the function of MERS-CoV-specific CD8+ T cells in this BALB/c mouse MERS-CoV lung infection model will be helpful to better estimate the role of cellular immunity in vaccine mediated protection in MERS-CoV infection.",
