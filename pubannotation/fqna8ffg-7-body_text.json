    "text": "Several, but mainly in vitro based studies, suggest a central function of the respiratory epithelium for the inflammatory response caused by carbonaceous nanoparticles. In this context it has been described that fine PM induces amphiregulin secretion by bronchial epithelial cells [40] . Our previous CNP inhalation study also detected induced pulmonary expression of this epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like molecule [13] . In vitro, high doses of CNP have been shown to trigger, apoptosis and proliferation of ATII cells via pathways using EGFreceptor signaling [41] . The amphiregulin EGF-receptor interaction may also cause MAP-kinase activation and thus function as a pro-inflammatory feedback loop in the lung epithelium [42] . But again, the in vivo relevance of all these epithelial or macrophage pathways for the initiation of CNP triggered inflammation is not confirmed.",
