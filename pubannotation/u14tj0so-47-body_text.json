    "text": "We compare the accuracy of HFold, HFold-PKonly and Iterative HFold with each other on different input structures, and with other methods, namely SimFold [63] , HotKnots V2.0 [36, 41] and IPknot [42] . We first describe the latter two methods and the settings we choose for our experiments. We then describe the ways in which we choose input structures for HFold and its variants.",
