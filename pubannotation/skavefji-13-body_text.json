    "text": "Pathogens that were identified in 47 patients are summarized in Table 2 . Twenty-eight bacterial pathogens were identified in 24 patients. In 4 patients, two different bacteria were identified. Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5) was the most common bacteria, followed by Legionella pneumophila (n = 4), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 3). Bacteria were identified from BAL fluid cultures or PCRs in 15 patients, from endotracheal aspirates or sputum cultures in 15 patients, from blood cultures in 4 patients, and from urinary antigen tests in 4 patients (two patients with pneumococcal antigens and two patients with legionella antigens). Eleven patients had two or more positive tests. Twenty-six viruses were identified in 23 patients. In three patients, two different viruses were identified. Rhinovirus was the most common virus (n = 11), followed by influenza virus (n = 6), and respiratory syncytial virus (n = 3). Viruses were identified from BAL fluid specimens in 18 patients and from nasopharyngeal specimens in 13 patients. Viruses were detected in both in BAL fluid and nasopharyngeal samples in 8 patients.",
