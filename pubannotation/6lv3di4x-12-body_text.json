    "text": "FIG 6 JEV-infected porcine NEC express chemokines and induce monocyte chemotaxis. RNA was extracted from NEC and gene expression of chemokines was determined by RT-qPCR for CCL2 (A), CCL5 (B), and CXCL10 (C). Data are shown as 25% to 75% interquartile boxes with means and Ϯ95% confidence intervals. Basolateral medium from porcine NEC at 72 hpi was used for chemotaxis experiments. (D) Mean values Ϯ SD are shown, with different superscript letters indicating significant difference (P Յ 0.05) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain (letters without and with apostrophe for JEV Laos and JEV Nakayama, respectively); differences between distinct JEV strains and mock at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks (*, P Յ 0.05; **, P Յ 0.002; ***, P Յ 0.001). that such cultures released monocyte chemoattractant factors, we next investigated infection of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) to mimic the possible subsequent in vivo cellular target following infection of NEC. Importantly, resting mucosal tissue resident macrophages have been described to have an \"M2-like\" functional status resembling that of IL-4-polarized macrophages (40, 41) . We therefore tested the infectivity of JEV released from NEC cultures for both nonpolarized and IL-4-polarized macrophages. To also assess potential additional factors released from the infected NEC cultures, we compared the infectivity of basolateral culture media obtained from infected NEC and JEV derived from Vero cell-propagated virus. Of note, the media used as infectious JEV sources were adjusted to the same multiplicity of infection (MOI).",
