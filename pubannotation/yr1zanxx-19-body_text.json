Mice were fed PLX5622 chow or control chow for 2 weeks, and APCs were assessed in blood (a-i) and spleen (j-r). a, j Representative flow cytometry plots of CD11c expression on CD45 + cells. b, k Quantification of percentages and c, l total numbers of CD45 + CD11c + cells. d, m Representative flow cytometry plots of MHCII expression on CD11c + CD45 + . e, n Quantification of percentages and f, o total numbers of MHCII + CD11c + CD45 + cells. g, p Representative flow cytometry plots of CD103 vs CD11b expression on CD11c + CD45 + cells. h, q Quantification of percentages and i, r total numbers of (I) CD103 + CD11b neg CD11c + CD45 + , (II) CD103 + CD11b + CD11c + CD45 + , (III) CD103 neg CD11b + CD11c + CD45 + , and (IV) CD103 neg CD11b neg CD11c + CD45 + cells. For quantification panels, each symbol represents an individual control (black) or PLX5622-treated (red) mouse, and bars indicate mean Â± SEM. Data shown represent analysis from one experiment with three to five mice per group, repeated in three independent experiments. Statistical significance was calculated using two-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparisons test. For all data: ns, not significant at P < 0.05; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001. CTRL: Control; PLX: PLX5622 Funk and Klein Journal of Neuroinflammation (2019) 16:22 As expected, WNV-NS5-E218A was barely detected in the kidney (Fig. 3j) , and the virus was steadily cleared from the serum (Fig. 3k) in both control-and PLX5622-treated mice. However, significantly higher levels of virus were detected in the spleen of PLX5622versus control-treated, WNV-NS5-E218A-infected mice at 4 dpi (Fig. 3i) , which was consistent with data obtained during f.p. infection with WNV-NY. Overall, CSF1R antagonism leads to enhanced mortality and loss of virologic control in both the periphery and CNS regardless of the WNV strain utilized, suggesting a critical role for this molecule in antiviral immunity. Fig. 2 PLX5622-treated mice exhibit increased mortality, increased encephalitis score, and impaired virologic control compared with control mice following peripheral infection with WNV-NY. a-d Mice were fed chow containing PLX5622 or control chow for 2 weeks, then infected with 10 2 or 10 4 PFU via footpad infection, then monitored for (a) mortality, (b) weight loss, and (c, d) encephalitis score for up to 25 dpi. a Survival curves show a significant increase in mortality in mice treated with PLX5622 compared with control-treated mice infected with either viral inoculum dose, as calculated by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. b Weight was measured daily during acute illness as a measure of illness. After death, the last measured weight was carried through to the end of the experiment. Significantly greater weight loss was measured in PLX5622-treated mice compared with controls infected with 10 2 PFU as calculated by two-way ANOVA with matched values comparing group means without multiple comparisons. c Clinical scores of PLX5622 or control-treated mice infected with 10 2 PFU or d 10 4 PFU as indicated during acute illness. 0 = subclinical, 1 = hunched/ruffled fur, 2 = altered gate/slow movement, 3 = no movement, but responsive to stimuli, 4 = moribund, 5 = dead. e-k Tissue viral loads as measured by plaque assay at 2, 4, 6, and 8 dpi following infection with 10 2 PFU in control (black) or PLX5622-treated (red) mice. l Serum viral loads as measured by qRT-PCR. e-l Data are presented as scatter plots with each mouse represented by a dot with the SEM indicated by a line. Dotted lines in e-l indicate assay limit of detection. All data presented are the compilation of two independent experiments with 10 mice per group. Statistical significance was calculated using two-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparisons test. For all data: ns, not significant at P < 0.05; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ****P < 0.0001 CSF1R signaling is required for activation of APC co-stimulatory function",
