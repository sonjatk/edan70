    "text": "In addition to total dietary fat, the fatty acid composition should also be considered. Based on the guaranteed analysis for total omega-3 fatty acids and inclusion of fish oil ( Table 1) , Diet A was expected to provide greater concentrations of long-chain omega-3 fatty acid. Dietary long-chain omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to modulate inflammation within the body, providing benefit to a variety of inflammatory medical conditions (19) . The underlying etiology was not defined in this study; however, IBD is commonly reported in feline gastroenteropathy, and the use of omega-3 fatty acids may have a beneficial effect in modulating the inflammatory response (19) . While the duration of this study was relatively short, fatty acid incorporation into intestinal tissues can occur fairly rapidly, with one study showing significantly higher concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in human colonic tissue following 7 days of supplementation compared to controls (20) . Additional studies evaluating diets with titrated levels of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids are required to better understand potential benefits in cats with chronic gastroenteropathy.",
