    "text": "Collectively, our results show that previously generated EV71 B4 genotype monoclonal antibody, which targeted VP1 linear epitope VC43 and neutralized subgenogroups B4 and B5 strains of EV71 in vitro [17] , was also able to cross-protect genotype C virus infection in vitro (Fig. 1 ) and in hSCARB2-transgenic mouse model. N3 conferred protection through the reduction of viral load and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines that contributed to viremic injury and immunopathogenesis.",
