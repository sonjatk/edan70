    "text": "The open source read mapping software SHRiMP2, which was shown to have high read mapping sensitivity [19] was chosen for the tool's ability to map as many reads as possible in the face of individual errors within each read [20] . All rabies reads were initially mapped to GenBank rabies reference sequence GI:260063801. This reference sequence was used as the common coordinate system for comparing samples and identifying coding frames. Based on a later observation that this newly sequenced rabies virus genome could differ by approximately 9% relative to our selected previously sequenced reference fox rabies sequence, we checked to see if observed error rates would increase by introducing random mutations at 9% of the control reference sequence, however, no noticeable increase in error rates were observed, suggesting that read mapping parameters were able to tolerate this rate of divergence. The Binomial error model defines the expected number of non consensus bases that should occur given the assumed PCR and sequencing error rate for a given number of observed reads, using a preset P-value (set to 0.01 with a Bonferonni correction). Nonconsensus base calls were made when the number of reads with the rare variant exceeded the expected count threshold [17] . The sequencing data used in this study including reads and the analysis files used to make all base calls is available at NCBI's archive BioProject # PRJNA216100.",
