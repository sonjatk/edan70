    "text": "We demonstrated that PGE 2 increased normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation through induction of PDK1, an ankyrin repeat-containing Ser/Thr kinase implicated in the induction of apoptosis and the suppression of tumor growth. PDK1 siRNA and a PDK1 inhibitor blocked the effects of PGE 2 on normal cell growth. The PGE 2induced PDK1 expression was blocked by an antagonist of the PGE 2 receptor subtype EP4 and by EP4 siRNA. In addition, we showed that induction of PDK1 by PGE 2 was associated with induction of the transcription factor, c-Jun protein. Silencing of c-Jun using siRNA and point mutations of c-Jun sites in the PDK1 gene promoter resulted in blockade of PDK1 expression and promoter activity induced by PGE 2 . In contrast, overexpression of c-Jun induced PDK1 gene promoter activity and expression followed increased cell proliferation.",
