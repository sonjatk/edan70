    "text": "Data were expressed as mean 6 standard deviation or median and 25-75% interquartile range according to data distribution. Categorical variables were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine the performances of BAL fluid cellular components, serum procalcitonin concentration, and C-reactive protein concentration for predicting bacterial pneumonia. Youden's Index (sensitivity + specificity-1) [18] was used to select the optimal cutoff points of the ROC curve. Area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were calculated. For positiveand negative predictive values, the prevalence of bacterial pneumonia in severe pneumonia patients admitted to the medical ICU was assumed to be 35.9%, based on our previous study [14] . Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors of bacterial pneumonia. Variables with P values less than 0.2 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate analysis. The correlation between BAL fluid white blood cell (WBC) count and APACHE II score was determined by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient. Significance was accepted at P # 0.05. All tests were performed using SPSS (version 18.0; SPSS, Inc.) and GraphPad Prism (version 5; GraphPad, Inc.) software. pneumonia underwent bronchoscopic BAL (67 with CAP, 159 with HCAP, and 133 with HAP). Of these patients, 100 were excluded because the pathogen was not identified, 42 were excluded because BAL fluid analysis was not possible (due to severe neutropenia or specimen clotting) or not performed, 52 were excluded because two or more types of pathogens were identified, and 100 were excluded because they received antimicrobial therapy for more than 24 hours before bronchoscopic BAL. Ten patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, 5 patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and 3 patients with mycobacterial pneumonia were also excluded. Finally, 47 patients (24 with bacterial pneumonia and 23 with viral pneumonia) were included.",
