    "text": "Recently, chronic activation of innate immune response by microglia is believed to be a major contributor to neurodegenerative conditions [72] . Genetic studies have confirmed the relevance of inflammatory response in common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis, indicating that neuroinflammation is likely implicated in the primary pathogenesis, rather than a secondary response [73] . We and others have reported that microglia impact neurocognitive function by executing complement-mediated synapse elimination [8, 74, 75] . Because of the neurological consequences of microglial activation, researchers have attempted to use CSF1R antagonism to deplete microglia in a variety of models to improve neurological function, including traumatic brain injury [38, 39] , brain irradiation [50] , myelin-induced catatonia [76] , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [40] , and Alzheimer's disease [41] . However, our results indicate that CSF1R antagonism may ultimately be detrimental to brain health due to loss of innate and adaptive immune response in the CNS, as well as decreased peripheral APC activation. Thus, in assessing the benefit of CSF1R antagonism, it will be important to consider the diminished immune response in both the CNS and peripheral immune compartments.",
