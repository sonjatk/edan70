Following that case, another patient from the Middle East with severe respiratory infection, who was transferred to the UK, was found to be infected with the same virus. On analyzing and comparing the samples from the Jordan outbreak with the latter ones, the same virus hCoV-EMC was recognized as causing this new and severe form of respiratory infection. It was later titled as MERS-CoV [6] . Since its first detection to this date, this virus has spread in countries across Middle East and Europe [7] . The highest number of cases has been identified in Saudi Arabia. Infections in European countries have been brought in by travel from the Middle East [7, 8] . From 2012 through the end of December 2018, the number of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV globally reported to the WHO was 2279 with 806 associated deaths, which corresponds to a fatality rate of approximately 35.36%. Saudi Arabia was on the top of the list of countries with 1901 reports of confirmed cases, including 732 related deaths with a fatality rate of approximately 39% [9] . Due to its high mortality rate (âˆ¼36%) [9, 10] and pathogenicity, nonavailability of vaccine or any other definite treatment, MERS-CoV is considered a major challenge to global health and presents a pressing need for the research and development of definite therapeutic options and adequate management to prevent its infection [11, 12] .",
