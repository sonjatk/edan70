    "text": "Our evolutionary screen also revealed strong signatures of positive selection in PARP9, PARP14 and PARP15. Strikingly, these three genes encode the only three human proteins that contain both a PARP catalytic domain and macrodomains, and are the only human genes to encode more than one macrodomain. The macrodomain is unique among protein domains in its ability to recognize mono-ADP-ribosylated proteins [47] . Furthermore, some macrodomains have recently been shown to catalyze the removal of mono-ADPr [15, 16] . Although the molecular functions of macro-PARPs are unclear, the presence of both PARP domains and macrodomains may conceivably allow them to both add and specifically recognize and/or reverse protein ADP-ribosylation. This, combined with the presence of macrodomains in viruses, prompted us to explore in more depth the evolution of other human macrodomain-containing proteins and ADP-ribosylhydrolases. Apart from the macro-PARPs, we found no evidence for positive selection in any other human gene encoding a macrodomain or ADP-ribosylhydrolase ( Figure S3 ), suggesting that the combination of the macro-and PARP domains is important for their rapid evolution and, consequently, for their putative antiviral roles.",
