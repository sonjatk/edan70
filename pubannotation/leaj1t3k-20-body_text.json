    "text": "PMOs were also reported to increase the survival of calicivirus-infected cats [89] . Studies have been done that directly compared PMO and PPMO antiviral activity in vivo. One study found that both PPMO-and PMO-treated mice survived EBOV lethal challenge (100% and 85% respectively, the difference being not statistically significant) [78] . However, other comparative reports clearly document that PPMO are far more effective than PMOs in mice. PPMOs offered 100% protection against EBOV infection at 5-μg and 50-μg doses while PMOs gave only 15% protection at 50-μg doses [64] . PPMOs increased survival of DENV-infected mice up to eight days whereas PMOs did not provide any survival benefit [70] . PMOs could not protect mice against WNV infection while PPMOs, even at doses 10-fold lower, delayed clinical signs and increased WNV-infected mice survival by 60% [67] . The differential activities observed in EBOV studies may be explained by the fact that Swenson et a l. used the (RXR) 4 XB peptide while Enterlein et al. linked their PMO to the R 9 F 2 C peptide.",
