    "text": "The pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network (Table S3 in File S2) contains a number of genes coding for TTN-interacting proteins, including cardiac myosin-binding protein C (Mybpc3; one of the original 24 transcripts), a-actinin (Actn2), obscurin (Obscn), Actc1, cardiac ankyrin protein [Ankrd1; also known as cardiac ankyrin repeat protein (CARP)], myomesin (Myom2), and four and a half LIM domains 2 (Fhl2). Of these TTN-interacting proteins, FHL2 interacts with the N2B domain (present in both isoforms), while CARP interacts with the N2A domain (present only in the longer N2BA isoform) (Linke 2008) . Both FHL2 and CARP have been shown to act as transcription factors in response to specific stimuli. For example, CARP is upregulated at the myofibril and in the nucleus in response to stretch (Miller et al. 2003) , while FHL2 is upregulated in response to RhoA signaling (Philippar et al. 2004 ). FHL2 has also been shown to interact with SRF to antagonize expression of smooth muscle genes in differentiating embryonic stem cells (Philippar et al. 2004) . Similarly, CARP overexpression in murine neonatal cardiomyocytes represses expression of Anf, Actc1, Acta1, bMHC, ventricular myosin light chain 2 (Myl2), and cardiac troponin C (Tnnc) (Mikhailov and Torrado Figure 5 A model for pulmonary myocardium gene regulation in response to hemodynamic stress. Based on our gene network analysis we propose that hemodynamic changes trigger mechanosensory (stretch-stress) signaling from the sarcomere via TTN, and initiate NO signaling cascades which are transmitted to the myocyte nucleus via NOSTRIN. These signals initiate dynamic regulation of gene expression to enable finetuning of the contractile properties of the pulmonary myocardium. Gene expression changes may also be regulated at the post-transcriptional level by RBM20 which could feedback to regulate Nostrin, Ttn, and Zfp451. Collectively, these effects are predicted to result in altered contractile properties, ion handling, and hormonal signaling in the pulmonary myocardium to direct an effective response to the initial hemodynamic cue. 2008); genes which are associated with our pulmonary myocardium gene network. We therefore propose a model whereby mechanosensing by TTN could lead to altered gene expression of the pulmonary myocardium gene network via FHL2 or CARP ( Figure 5 ), which might exert opposing transcriptional effects depending on the TTN isoform expressed (as CARP signaling would only be activated by the N2BA isoform). Interestingly, Fhl2 had one of the highest fold-changes in expression in the left atria of patients with atrial fibrillation compared to healthy controls (Deshmukh et al. 2015) , supporting a role for dysregulated TTN signaling in the pathobiology of atrial fibrillation.",
