    "text": "To evaluate beat frequencies between the upper limit of normal (approximately 16 Hz) for respiratory cilia and the lower limit of normal for ependymal cilia (approximately 36 Hz) we slowed ependymal ciliary beat frequency by the addition of the pneumococcal toxin, pneumolysin. We have previously shown pneumolysin to reduce ependymal ciliary beat frequency [4] . Pneumolysin was purified as previously described [19] . Cells were exposed to 1 ml M199 containing 300 ng of pneumolysin, which was preheated to 37Â°C. The CBF was measured at intervals of 0, 5, and 15 minutes over the course of the experiment. At each time point, images were captured from four different areas along the ciliated edge of the brain slice.",
