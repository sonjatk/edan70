    "text": "The number of live and dead mice was counted every 12 hr for 5 days to investigate the viability in each TG line after the femoral muscle was challenged with 10 LD 50 PRV was ( Figure S4B) . Figure 7B shows that the viability of WT mice challenged with PRV was 11% (2/18). The viabilities of the STG69 and STG135 lines against PRV challenges were about 40% (8/20) and 17% (4/24), respectively. However, the STG90 line showed 53% (9/17) viability. These data were described by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Mice generally began to exhibit clinical signs of illness 3-5 days post-challenge ( Figure 7C) .",
