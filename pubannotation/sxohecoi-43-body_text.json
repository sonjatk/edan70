    "text": "The alkaline phosphatase immunohistology technique was described previously ( [75] ). Two anti-FcRn antibodies were used: 1) Anti-FcRn antibody purified from rabbit serum raised against a2 (88-177aa) and a3 (1782-247aa) domains of human FcRn (provided by Neil Simister, Brandeis University) for use on frozen sections ( Figure 5) , and 2) rabbit anti-FcRn antibody obtained from Novus Biologicals for use on paraffin sections following citrate buffer (pH 6.0) antigen retrieval ( Figure S7 ). Sections were blocked with serum-free protein solution, and optimally diluted primary FcRn antibodies or rabbit IgG (negative control) were added and incubated for 1-2 hours at RT. Binding of antibodies to FcRn in tissues was visualized using an alkaline phosphatase detection system that stains positive cells bright red. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and cover-slipped using aqueous mounting medium.",
