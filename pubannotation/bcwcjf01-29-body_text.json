    "text": "Both consensus and deep-sequencing data indicate that the haplotype associated with sustained fox-to-fox transmission during the 2009 outbreak occurred prior to 2009 since several nonsynonymous mutations that were present in the consensus sequences of skunk and fox rabies samples obtained from 2003-2010 were present at the sub-consensus level (as rare variants in the viral population) in skunk and fox samples from 1995 ( Figure 5 ). Analysis of the Illumina ultra-deep sequencing data supported the hypothesis that variants that were later enriched to become consensus could be detected at higher frequencies than variants that did not. In particular, all of the mutations that distinguish the 1995/96 haplotype from the 2003/10 haplotype were present as rare variants in Fx 31, the only 2003 sample for which there is deep sequencing Illumina data available. These results suggest that analysis of rare variants within a viral population may yield clues to ancestral haplotypes and identify rare haplotypes that have the potential to be selected for if environment conditions change. Figure S1 Coverage of the rabies genome by the two sequencing platforms. Red: Illumina-Eureka genomics. Blue: 454. Each trace corresponds to coverage for one sample. Color bars at the bottom denote locations of the 5 proteins in the rabies genome: N, P, M, G, L (from the left to right). Illumina data was generated using overlapping read pairs (ORP). ORP analysis is a new method that assesses genome position specific sequencing error. The approach uses paired-end sequencing to sequence a single DNA fragment twice. Sequencing is initiated once from each end of the DNA fragment to produce two distinct sequencer reads. In other applications paired-end sequencing uses larger fragment sizes to ensure that each read generated from the same DNA fragment covers different parts of the molecule to recover more of the original fragment. ORP uses shorter DNA fragments and longer read lengths to maximize the number of bases in the DNA fragment, which are sequenced twice. The redundant sequencing means reads with base calls that disagree with their overlapping pair are recognized as errors and are discarded to effectively lower the sequencing error rate. A position specific base call supported by a read pair can still disagree with the consensus base call leading to detection of rare variants. ORPs provide an important benefit over the alternative of adding higher sequencer coverage since the detected mismatches between read pairs give an empirically derived sequencing error rate, which is specific to each sequencer run. shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically as follows. When the number of common sites was ,100 or less than one fourth of the total number of sites, the maximum parsimony method was used; otherwise BIONJ method with MCL distance matrix was used. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 44 amino acid sequences. The coding data was translated assuming a Standard genetic code table. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 262 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5. (DOC) Figure S4 Phylogram constructed from M gene amino acid sequence. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the JTT matrix-based model. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-631.6601) is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a JTT model, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 46 amino acid sequences. The coding data was translated assuming a Standard genetic code table. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 202 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5. (DOC) Figure S5 Phylogram constructed from G gene amino acid sequence. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method as described for Fig. S3 . The tree with the highest log likelihood (-1510.8247) is shown. The analysis involved 44 amino acid sequences. The coding data was translated assuming a Standard genetic code table. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 490 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5. (DOC) Figure S6 Phylogram constructed from L gene amino acid sequence. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method as described for Fig. S3 . The tree with the highest log likelihood (-3901.1361) is shown. The analysis involved 38 amino acid sequences. The coding data was translated assuming a Standard genetic code table. All positions with less than 95% site coverage were eliminated. There were a total of 1322 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5. (DOC) Figure S7 Phylogram generated using nucleotide sequences from the noncoding regions. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method as described for Figure 1 . The analysis involved 43 nucleotide sequences. All positions with less than 95% site coverage were eliminated. There were a total of 862 positions in the final dataset. Samples and regions are labeled as previously described. Figure S9 Genomic distribution of rabies variants found by Illumina sequencing. Not all rare variants were included for this graph, only those variants (N = 248) that occurred at above 1% in an individual sample or have a cumulative frequency of .1% over all samples were displayed here. Colorbar on the right indicates the frequency of these rare variants. Variants occurring at above 1% in an individual sample appears as green to red pixels, and variants that occur at lower frequencies in an individual sample but occur in multiple samples such that their cumulative frequencies is .1% appear as blue vertical streaks. Table S2 Sample metadata. Sample collection date and location (city or county) are listed. In many cases the street location was obtained for a sample and this information was used for placement of the sample in Figure 2 .",
