    "text": "Finally, in Fig. S5 , we plot the critical time t c , computed from the simulations at Φ S (t) = V s c , as a function of T for different values of t r . We can see that for the same transmissibility T , when t r increase, the time to intervene grows since β decrease and thus the disease spreading is retarded. In turn, when the transmissibility T reaches T * from above, the critical time t c grows very fast. This phenomenon is analogous to other second order phase transitions in physics like the relaxation time near the Curie temperature, which are called \"critical slowing down\" [9, 10] , and indicates that that once the transmissibility increases slightly above T * , the time needed to destroy the giant susceptible cluster decreases very fast.
