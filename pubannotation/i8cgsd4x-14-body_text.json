    "text": "To further confirm that CxCul4 is a negative regulator of Jak-STAT pathway, Hsu cells were transfected with a plasmid (p6x2DRAF-Luc) containing a Firefly luciferase reporter gene under Drosophila STAT-responsive elements, along with dsRNA against CxCul4. After 24 h, cells were infected with WNV and luciferase activity was measured 16 hpi. The results showed that CxCul4 knockdown resulted in increased luciferase activity in WNV-infected cells using anti-WNV NS5 and anti-β-actin antibodies conducted on lysates collected from cells treated as in B. Molecular weight markers represented as kDa. The band at around 95 kDa is expected size of WNV-NS5; while band at 191 kDa is non-specific. E. Hsu cells were transfected with Culex Cul4 overexpression plasmid. Empty vector (Control) was used as a transfection control. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with WNV and cell lysates were collected at 48 hpi. Total RNA was collected from cells and real-time RT-qPCR was performed using WNV NS1-specific primers. RpL32 primers were used as an internal control. Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05, comparing between control and Cul4-transfected cells). F. Viral titer estimation by plaque assays conducted on the supernatant media collected from cells treated as in E. G. Hsu cells were transfected with Culex Cul4 overexpression plasmid. Empty vector (Empty) was used as a transfection control. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with WNV and cell lysates were collected at 48 hpi. Western blot was performed using anti-V5 (detecting CxCul4 overexpression) and anti-β-actin antibodies. Molecular weight markers represented as kDa. Culex cullin (Cul4) blocks the Jak-STAT pathway. A. Hsu cells were transfected with plasmid overexpressing Culex cullin (CxCul4). Empty vector (Control) was used as transfection control. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with WNV and total RNA was collected at 48 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using Culex Vir1-specific and Culex Vago-specific primers. RpL32 primers were used as an internal control. Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05, comparing between control and Cul4-overexpressing cells). B. Hsu cells were transfected with plasmid overexpressing Culex cullin (CxCul4). Empty vector (Control) was used as transfection control. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with CxVago-containing medium and total RNA was collected 48 h later. Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using Culex Vir1-specific primers. RpL32 primers were used as an internal control. Error bars represent standard error from three ( Fig 4C) . As a positive control, cells were stimulated with heat-inactivated E. coli for 1 h, which also showed increased luciferase activity.",
