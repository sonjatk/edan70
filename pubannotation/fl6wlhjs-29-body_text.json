    "text": "We fit the chest radiograph model given by (1) to the first ten months of data for each ED in city k. After specifying a model for {R k,t }, we have a regression model with time series errors, that can be fit using standard maximum likelihood methods. We selected the order of the SARIMA model for the time series errors, {X k,t }, as defined by (4) in the Appendix using standard identification techniques based on the sample autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation (e.g., [18] ). To facilitate the comparison of the time series models across cities, we restricted to same order of model for each series. The orders p k = 1 and q k = 1, correspond to a single autoregressive and moving average term on the daily scale, equivalent to observing an autoregressive process of first order with measurement error ( [19] , Exercise 2.9). With a seasonal period of seven days (s = 7), we set P k = 1 and Q k = 1, so that the random seasonal component is a combination of an autoregressive and moving average term, each of first order over a period of seven days. The seasonal component of the time series model corresponds to an evolution of a first order autoregressive process with a measurement error over the weeks.",
