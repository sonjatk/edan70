A plot of the actual specificity (the specificity calculated using the training data) minus the nominal specificity (1 -α) for different values of α using a linear filter, for four different models. The value of the detection threshold τ k,α , was calculated using a normal approximation. Receiver operating characteristic curves for the four models Figure 9 Receiver operating characteristic curves for the four models. Receiver operating characteristic curves (averaged over 500 simulations of an anthrax outbreak) for the detection of the anthrax outbreak signature in the chest radiographs at each of the five metropolitan children's hospitals using the four different models. The linear filter is used in each case. MinnStPaul varied across the five EDs studied ( Figure 6 ). The tradeoff between specificity and sensitivity also varied by the ED (Figures 6 and 7) . The 1-day filter, while closely matching the nominal specificity, performed poorly in terms of maximizing the sensitivity to detect an outbreak signature. The 7-day filter, by smoothing over the outbreak signature ( Figure 5 ), maximized the sensitivity, but at a compromise to the actual specificity obtained (Figures 6  and 7) . The linear and exponential filters provided a balance between the specificity and sensitivity. Detection using our covariate-based seasonal time series model performed well across all EDs compared with fixed-effects regression models or time series models that omitted seasonal terms and/or covariates (Figures 8 and 9 ). denotes the one-step ahead prediction for the SARIMA process and {b k,1 , ..., b k,m } are obtained from the solution of the set of m linear equations:",
