    "text": "Experiments were performed to determine whether WNV infection leads to STAT degradation via CxCul4. Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4 and infected with WNV at 24 h post-transfection. Total cell lysates were collected at 24 hours post-infection and Western blot was performed using anti-CxSTAT antibody. As a control, cells were either transfected with GFP dsRNA (Control). The results (Fig 5C) showed cells infected with WNV showed decreased CxSTAT levels, which returned to baseline in cells transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4. Although, we cannot rule out the possibility that reduced degradation of CxSTAT upon CxCul4 knockdown is due to lower virus replication, these results combined with other data indicate that WNV infection leads to degradation of CxSTAT via CxCul4.",
