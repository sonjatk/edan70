NHRI-IACUC-101006-A). 5746-TW98 (C2) strain elicits a lethal neurological virulence of hind limb paralysis (HLP) and E59 (B4) can induce HFMD-like hair loss associated with scurf (HLS) and a non-lethal HLP in hSCARB2-transgenic mice [11] . In the protection of C2 EV71challenge, survival rate was used as one of end points to assess the protective efficacy of anti-EV71 medication. Survival rate used as an index of pathogenesis of EV71 infection in experimental animal models has been reported by many studies [5, 6, 8, 11] . In B4 challenge test, scoring of mice with HLS and HLP was performed. After the investigation or when weight loss of 20% occurred, tested animals were euthanasia by 100% CO2 inhalation for 5 minutes followed by cervical dislocation to minimize the animals suffering. To perform virus challenge, mice were explored in the anesthetic inhalator chamber containing isoflurane (For initial phase: 5%, for maintainced phase: 1.5%,2.5%) for 1 minutes before subcutaneously or intraperitoneally immunized with EV71 or antibody, respectively.",
