    "text": "In programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF), mRNA signals induce a proportion of translating ribosomes to slip back by 1 nucleotide (nt) into an overlapping open reading frame (ORF) and to continue translation, al-lowing the coordinated expression of two or more proteins from a single mRNA (1) (2) (3) . First described as the mechanism by which the Gag-Pol polyprotein of the retrovirus Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is expressed from overlapping gag and pol ORFs (4), related −1 PRF signals have been documented in many other viruses of clinical, veterinary and agricultural importance (reviewed in Ref. 5 ). PRF has also been increasingly recognized in conventional cellular genes of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes as well as in other replicating elements, such as insertion sequences and transposons (6, 7) .",
