    "text": "Since virus-infected brood and adults are often expelled from honeybee colonies [33-36] and ants are often seen foraging such bees in apiaries (personal observations), it appears as if ants are very likely to consume DWV-infected food. However, there are only few studies on virus transmission between honeybees and ants. DWV and Kashmir Bee Virus (KBV) presence plus replication was detected in invasive argentine ants (Linepithema humile) as well as presence of Black queen cell virus (BQCV) in Linepithema humile and Anoplolepis gracilipes [37] [38] [39] . Further, DWV and other honeybee viruses (BQCV, Israeli acute paralysis virus and Sacbrood virus) were detected in Camponotus sp. ants [19] . Similarly, chronic bee paralysis virus seems to be able to replicate in ants Camponotus vagus [29] . So far, no study has yet experimentally addressed the efficacy of foodborne virus transmission between honeybees and predators/scavengers. Since ants are ubiquitous and play essential roles in terrestrial ecosystem functioning [40] [41] [42] [43] , virus transmission from managed honeybees might pose a considerable threat, given the virus is able to exploit the novel hosts. On the other hand, viruses and other pathogens may help limiting the spread of invasive M. rubra populations [37, 44] . Novel hosts can be biological vectors that support virus replication or reservoirs and mechanical vectors without virus replication [4] . Further, spillover events can also be bidirectional, from the novel host back to the initial host [1], possibly resulting in altered virulence and respective consequences as e.g., for influenza [45] .",
