    "text": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a positive strand RNA virus which codes for three known open reading frames (ORFs) [6] . ORF1 codes for non structural proteins, essential for viral replication; ORF2 codes for the major capsid protein of HEV, called ORF2 protein; and ORF3 codes for a phosphoprotein which may play a key role in manipulating various host-cell processes during viral infection, and may have a role in cell survival and propagation of the virus [7, 8] . Although HEV infection is generally self-limiting, it induces fulminant hepatic failure, which results in a very high mortality rate in pregnant women. A recent study done by Prusty and coworkers has demonstrated that NF-ÎºB activity is suppressed in the PBMC and liver biopsy samples of pregnant fulminant hepatic failure patients [9] . However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown.",
