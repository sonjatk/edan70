    "text": "A plaque reduction neutraliszation test (PRNT) assay was performed on pooled day 35 sera from mice immunised with either the control pVax1 plasmid, the consensus ZIKV-prME plasmid vaccine or a consensus ZIKV-C (capsid) plasmid vaccine. The PRNT assay used was a method adapted from a previously described technique for analysing dengue virus, West Nile virus and other flaviviruses. 16 As shown in Figure 3e , ZIKV-prME vaccination yielded significant neutralisation response with anti-ZIKV reciprocal PRNT 50 dilution titres (inverse of the serum dilution at which 50% of the control ZIKV infection was inhibited) of 456 ± 5, whereas the PRNT50 of sera from ZIKV-Cap DNA vaccine immunized mice was 33 ± 6 which was minimally higher than that of sera from pVax1 control plasmid vaccinated animals (titre = 15 ± 2).",
