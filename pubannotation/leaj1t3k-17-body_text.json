    "text": "Besides improving PMO cellular uptake, the CPP moiety was also shown to intensify PMO antisense activity against EBOV by 10-to 100-fold in cell-free translation assays [64] . These results are consistent with the findings of Nelson et a l. who showed that PPMOs exhibited antisense activity 3-to 25-fold higher than corresponding PMOs while bearing lower off-target effects [87] . The authors propose that the arginine-rich peptides enhance RNA-PMO binding affinity thereby increasing specific antisense activity.",
