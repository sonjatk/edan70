    "text": "Samples from the gastrointestinal tract showed the greatest RQ and the highest proportion of viral presence in infected individuals with rectal swabs showing the highest recovery of SADV DNA (RQ mean = 81.09 ± 99.81 CI, n = 6) and small intestine being the tissue with the greatest intensity of infection (RQ mean = 46.91 ± 67.69 CI, n = 6) and the highest proportion of infection (0.83 (5/6), 0.37-0.99 CI). Out of all other tissues, the liver showed a proportionately high intensity of infection (RQ mean = 7.04 ± 5.97 CI, n = 11). Interestingly, lice showed both a high ratio of SADV to squirrel DNA (RQ mean = 78.24 ± 152.23 CI, n = 5) and where present on an infected squirrel the prevalence of SADV infection in lice was high (0.8 (4/5), 0.30-0.99 CI).",
