    "text": "When an RNA molecule folds, bonds may form between canonical pairs of bases (A-U, C-G, and G-U) (see Figure 1 ). Throughout this work, we consider only cases where each base may pair at most with one other base, and represent base pairing between i and j by i.j. We define a secondary structure, R, as a set of pairs i.j, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n; i.j and k.j can belong to the same set if and only if i = k.",
