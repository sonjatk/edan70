    "text": "Susceptibility based antibiotic treatment in patients with a significant BAL-culture is routine in our centre. In general, antibiotics are administered orally for 10 days (daily dose: 50-75 mg/kg for amoxicillin or amoxicillinclavulanate). 7 Of 16 (43,8 %) patients responded well to treatment, in 3 of 16 (18,8 %) no change in symptoms was noted, and data were missing for 6 patients. In 4 of 7 (57,1 %) responders however, symptoms relapsed within 2-3 weeks after completion of the antibiotic treatment. In one of these patients, FOB + BAL was repeated 70 days after the initial procedure. NTHi (>10 5 colony forming units (cfu)/ml) that was present as sole pathogen in the first BAL fluid was cultured again together with S. pneumoniae (>10 5 cfu/ml).",
