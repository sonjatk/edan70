    "text": "In addition to the change of mean weekly vomiting episodes within treatment groups, it was also of interest to consider the number of cats that reached resolution, or no vomiting episodes, over the weekly period. The probability of vomiting declined during the course of the study, with a significant decline in cats fed Diet A in weeks 2-4, with a 0.2 probability in the final week. Sixty seven percent (n = 8) of the cats fed Diet A and 47% (n = 7) of the cats fed Diet B had no vomiting episodes at the final week of the study. Of these 15 cats, 3 showed an episodic pattern over the 4-week period, with 1 or more weeks without vomiting followed by a later week with vomiting.",
