Just as in Figure 4 with the radiograph series, we calculate the 0.025, 0.5 (median), and 0.975 quantiles of the filtered radiograph series on each day t, based on the model fit to the Akron ED series. Figure  5 shows the time-varying quantiles for each of the four filters. Relative to the no-outbreak situation, positive values",
