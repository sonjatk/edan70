    "text": "To map more precisely this specific epitope within the MERS-CoV N protein, we concentrated on the overlapping 11-mer peptide shared between peptides #89 and #90 and obtained nine 8-10-mer peptides (Table 1) . Using these peptides for the stimulation of splenoctyes from MVA-MERS-N vaccinated mice, we obtained the highest numbers of IFN-Î³ producing T cells with peptide 10.2 (mean levels of 94 to 97 SFC/10 6 splenocytes), while the other peptides (10.1, 9.1, 9.
