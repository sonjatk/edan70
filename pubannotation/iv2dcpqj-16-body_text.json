    "text": "The observation that overexpression of eEF1A resulted in the inhibition of the CSFV IRES activity prompted an examination of the interaction between eEF1A and IRES of CSFV. Streptavidin pulldown assay showed that the biotinylated CSFV IRES, but not the biotinylated porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) 3 1 -UTR, could bind to eEF1A in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 6A,B) . Competitive RNA pulldown assay indicated that the association of eEF1A with the CSFV IRES could be inhibited by the unlabeled CSFV IRES ( Figure 6C ). The results demonstrated that eEF1A binds to the CSFV IRES and inhibits its activity.",
