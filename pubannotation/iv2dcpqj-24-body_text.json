    "text": "The swine eEF1A gene (GenBank accession no. NM_001097418.2) and its various domains were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pCMV-Myc vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) to generate pMyc-eEF1A, pMyc-eEF1A(1-333), pMyc-eEF1A(1-237), pMyc-eEF1A(238-462) and pMyc-eEF1A(201-333), respectively. The CSFV NS5A gene (GenBank accession no. EU497410.1) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the p3ˆFlag-CMV-10 vector (Sigma-Aldrich, ST. Louis, MO, USA) or pCMV-Myc to generate p3ˆFlag-NS5A or pMyc-NS5A. The primers for amplifying eEF1A and NS5A genes are listed in Table 1 .",
