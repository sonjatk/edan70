    "text": "In summary, we isolated the geranylated flavonoids diplacone, mimulone and 4 0 -O-methyldiplacone from P. tomentosa and showed their inhibitory activities against Cp-NanI using comparative activity screening. The first crystal structure of sialidase with a geranylated flavonoid provides structural insights into the binding mode of natural flavonoid-based inhibitors at atomic resolution. The higher inhibitory potency of diplacone relative to the other compounds studied here can be ascribed to two principal factors. Firstly, the 3 0 -hydroxyl group stabilizes the enzyme-inhibitor complex through hydrogen bonding to the main chain of Ala292. Secondly, additional hydrophobic interactions are observed between the geranyl group and the hydrophobic pocket formed by Phe353, Trp354 and Tyr587 in the active site. Importantly, in the four variants of human sialidase this pocket has a significantly different polarity and would not be expected to interact favorably with the geranyl group. Glu111, Tyr179 and Tyr181 of human Neu2 are not conserved in bacterial and viral sialidases and are considered as important sites for the design of selective drugs targeting bacteria and viruses (Burmeister et al., 1993) . However, our biochemical and structural data suggest that the hydrophobic binding pocket of Cp-NanI which binds the geranyl group within diplacone may also be exploited as a means to derive selectivity for bacterial versus human sialidases. Our results will provide valuable information for the design of new selective antibacterial or antiviral agents using flavonoids.",
