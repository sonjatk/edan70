    "text": "In conclusion, the present study reported the circulating HAdV types and their prevalence in paediatric patients with SARI in China. HAdV was frequently (76/552, 13.77%) detected, and HAdV-B and HAdV-C were the most predominant in Northern and Eastern China, respectively. However, we only amplified relatively conserved partial hexon sequences rather than the hypervariable region (HVR), perhaps resulting in the loss of the recombinant and variant information. More extensive studies will be needed to address the prevalence and geographic distribution of dominant genotypes of HAdV using well-matched control groups and sequential samples collected over a longer time. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, HAdV-37 (KM378014) and HAdV-57 (KM377992) are the first strains of these genotypes to be reported in inpatient children with SARI.",
