    "text": "JEV efficiently infects primary porcine NEC. To confirm and further investigate the ability of JEV to infect porcine NEC from their apical side, we utilized well-differentiated ALI cultures established from porcine nasal mucosa. These experiments showed that both JEV strains infected cultures from the apical side, resulting in virus replication (Fig.  2) . Again, the Laos strain showed statistically significantly higher levels of viral RNA than the Nakayama strain. Despite that, the two JEV strains tested displayed similar replication profiles, reaching a maximum at 72 hpi ( Fig. 2A) . To test for apical and/or basolateral live virus shedding upon infection, we collected basolateral chamber culture media and performed apical washings of the infected NEC. The results demonstrate that JEV was apically shed after infection with both JEV strains (Fig. 2B) . Interestingly, similar JEV titers were detected in the culture media collected from the basolateral and apical sides of the inserts (Fig. 2C) , supporting the idea that infection of epithelial cells could result in a systemic infection. With respect to RNA levels, the maximum titers were reached at 72 hpi in both compartments of the ALI system. At 72 hpi, as shown in Fig. 2D , we visualized JEV infection of NEC by labeling of virus (E protein, green), nuclei (4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride [DAPI], dark blue), tight junctions (ZO-1, light blue), and cilia (␤-tubulin, red). While we observed mainly isolated E protein-positive cells for the Nakayama strain, the Laos strain led to the formation of clusters of E protein-positive cells (Fig. 2D) and colocalization of E protein and ␤-tubulin signals, suggesting replication in ciliated epithelial cells (Fig. 2E) . Porcine nasal mucosa explants were challenged with JEV Laos or Nakayama at 10 5 TCID 50 /sample for 2 h, followed by wash steps and culture in medium for 48 h. In panel A, nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue), cilia with anti-␤-tubulin (red), and JEV with anti-E protein 4G2 (green). The scale bar represents 10 m. Three-dimensional (3D) scans were acquired using confocal microscopy. In panel B, a higher magnification of panel A is shown. In panel C, viral RNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Results were calculated as fold change of the threshold cycle and are represented as 25 to 75% interquartile boxes showing the mean and 95% confidence intervals. Different superscript letters indicate significant difference (P Յ 0.05) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain (letters without or with apostrophe for JEV Laos and Nakayama strain, respectively); significant differences between distinct JEV strains at the same time postinfection are shown by an asterisk.",
