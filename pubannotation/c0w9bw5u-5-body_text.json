    "text": "The IFNβ-luc reporter plasmid and RIG-I expression plasmid are gifts from Professor Takashi Fujita (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). 28 The expression plasmids for TBK1, IRF3 and TRAF3 were generous gifts from Dr Genhong Cheng (University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA), 33, 34 whereas those for RIG-I N, IKK-ε and MAVS and IκB-α as well as IRF3-luc and κB-luc reporter plasmids have been described elsewhere. 30, [35] [36] [37] Viral RNA was extracted from MERS-CoV-infected Vero-E6 cells. The M gene was PCR-amplified from complementary DNA and cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pCAGEN plasmid with the addition of a C-terminal V5-tag with the following primers: 5′-ATG TCT AAT ATG ACG CAA CTC ACT GA-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGC TCG AAG CAA TGC AAG TTC-3′ (reverse). The SARS-CoV M protein expression plasmid has been described elsewhere. 30, 32 The expression plasmids for the SN and MN chimeras were constructed by assembly PCR with the following forward primers covering the breakpoints: 5′-AGG CTG TTT GCT CGT ACC CGC TCA TGG TGG TCA TTC AAT CCT GAG-3′ (SN) and 5′-CCG GCT GTT TAT GAG AAC TGG ATC AAT GTG GTC ATT CAA CCC A-3′ (MN). The reverse primers were complementary to their respective forward primers. The truncation mutant of the SN chimera lacking the first transmembrane domain was constructed using the forward primer: 5′-ATG GTA ACA CTT GCT TGT TTT GTG CT-3′.",
