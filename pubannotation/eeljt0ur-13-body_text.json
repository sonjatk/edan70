    "text": "Cats fed both Diets A and B had a numerical reduction in the mean weekly number of vomiting episodes, with little to no change in weekly diarrhea episodes, over the 4-week period ( Table 2 ). There were no differences between diet groups in the mean weekly number of vomiting or diarrhea episodes (p > 0.05). Significant differences were seen in vomiting episodes over time within cats fed Diet A between week 0 and weeks 2-4. These had fold changes in the number of vomiting occurrences Table 3) . Changes in vomiting episodes within cats fed Diet B did not reach significance over the 4-week study period (p > 0.05) ( Table 3) Table 4 ). The change in probability of vomiting within cats fed Diet B did not reach significance over the 4-week study period (p > 0.05) ( Table 4) .",
