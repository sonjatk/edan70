    "text": "IκBα was found to be degraded at a chase period of 90 minutes ( Figure 2A) . Notably, the levels of IκBα at the end of the labeling period (0 minute chase) in IKKβ alone expressing cells were less than that in IKKβ and ORF2 coexpressing cells, indicating that IκBα is a very labile protein in IKKβ expressing cells. The graph represents quantitative measurement of band intensities of IκBα at the indicated time points assuming the band intensity at the onset of the chase as 100%. To further confirm whether IκBα stabilization actually blocked nuclear translocation of NF-κB in ORF2 expressing cells, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were separated in mock and ORF2 transfected cells and equal amounts of samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-p65 antibody. As seen in Figure 2B , ORF2 transfected cells were found to accumulate more p65 protein in the cytoplasmic fraction than in the nuclear fraction ( Figure 2B , lane 2 and 4; see the densitometric estimation of band intensities in the graph below). As expected, mock transfected cells were found to contain more p65 protein in the nuclear fraction ( Figure 2B , lane 1 and 3). This is attributed to the fact that basal NF-κB activity is higher in Huh7 cells [13] . In order to check the purity of fractions obtained in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions and as loading controls, equal amounts of both fractions from each sample were immunoblotted with anti-calnexin and anti-phospho c-Jun antibodies.",
