    "text": "Further evaluation of the cellular immunogenicity of the ZIKV-prME vaccine entailed the determination of the polyfunctional properties of CD8 + T cells collected 1 week after the final immunisation. The results show that the ZIKV-prME vaccination increased the proportion of bifunctional vaccine-specific T cells expressing TNF-α (tumour necrosis factor-α) and IFN-γ. Importantly, ZIKV-prME vaccination exhibited a strong ability to expand T cell functionality (Figure 2d ).",
