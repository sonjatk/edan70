    "text": "Cytology BAL-fluid was transported to the laboratory in a siliconized container on ice. The fluid was filtered through nylon gauze. After staining with brilliant cresyl blue, total nuclear cell counts were performed in a Bürker counting chamber under light microscopy at a magnification of 250x. A cell suspension of 2.10 6 cells/ μl was made in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 % bovine serum albumin (PBS-BSA). Cytocentrifuge preparations were made and stained by May-Grünwald Giemsa. Two hundred cells were examined for differential cell counts.",
