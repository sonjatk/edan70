    "text": "RNA extraction and RT-qPCR. RNA was extracted using NucleoSpin RNA II filtered columns (Macherey-Nagel). cDNA was generated with the Omniscript reverse transcription (RT) kit (Qiagen) using random hexamers (Thermo Fisher). RT-quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using TaqMan Fast Universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The primer and probe sequences used in this work are listed in Table 1 . Fold change of gene expression was calculated using the threshold cycle (2 ϪΔΔCT ) method (69) , and the 18S housekeeping gene was used for normalization. Relative gene expression results are presented on a base 2 logarithmic scale.",
