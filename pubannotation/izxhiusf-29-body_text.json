    "text": "Capsular typing of H. influenzae isolates revealed that all 10 isolates were non-encapsulated strains (NTHi). All 10 NTHi strains were evaluated for misidentification of non-haemolytic H. haemolyticus, and all were proven true NTHi. Nine of ten (90 %) NTHI isolates were β-lactamase negative and susceptible to ampicillin (MIC ≤ 1μg/ml) and cefuroxime (MIC ≤ 1μg/ml) [16] . The latter isolate was β-lactamase positive, with a MIC = 2μg/ml for amoxicillin-clavulanate and MIC = 3μg/ml for cefuroxime. The 4 S. pneumoniae isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin and belonged to serogroups; ST 6, ST 9, ST 11 and ST 19.",
