    "text": "In the human respiratory tract cilia beat in a coordinated fashion at a frequency of approximately 10 to 14 Hz, propelling mucus towards the pharynx where it is swallowed [1] . This process is known as mucociliary clearance (MCC). In the brain, ependymal cilia beat at a frequency of around 40 Hz, moving cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) close to the ventricular wall. Many factors, including inherited ciliary defects in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), temperature, pH, viscosity and exposure to bacterial and viral pathogens have been shown affect ciliary function [2] [3] [4] [5] . Recent studies have shown that assessment of both ciliary beat pattern and frequency are essential as cilia may beat in a dyskinetic fashion while maintaining their normal beat frequency [5] [6] [7] . The most accurate method for determining ciliary beat frequency, particularly at high beat frequencies is by directly timing a given number of individual ciliary beat cycles from slow-motion playback of high-speed video files [7] . However, this is extremely time consuming and automated methods designed to rapidly measure beat frequency from high-speed video recordings are needed [8] [9] [10] .",
