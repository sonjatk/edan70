    "text": "Early automated methods, including the laser lightscattering spectroscopy, photodiode and photomultiplier methods were developed to calculate ciliary beat frequency (CBF) based on changes in light intensity around beating cilia under the microscope [11] [12] [13] . More recently, a number of bespoke image analysis software programs have been developed to automatically compute CBF from video files captured using video microscopy [8] [9] [10] . This software computes changes in pixel intensity over time (as shown in Figure 1A ) to Hertz using fast Fourier transformation (FFT), a function that has been used frequently for this application [14, 15] . However, the studies that describe this software lack two important elements: comparison of their results to the direct measurement of ciliary beat frequency from slow-motion video replay of cilia, and the measurement cilia that beat at very high frequencies [8, 9] . This is important as some phenotypes of PCD display respiratory cilia that beat at frequencies above 16 Hz and brain ependymal cilia beat at frequencies higher than 36 Hz. In this paper, we describe software that was validated by comparing results to those obtained by direct measurement of high-speed video recordings of cilia. The program also runs using open-source software. To evaluate a wide range of ciliary beat frequencies we studied both human respiratory cilia and ependymal cilia from the rat brain. Respiratory cilia usually beat at less than 16 Hz [7] and brain cilia usually beat at over 36 Hz. To obtain CBF measurements above 16 Hz, we slowed the frequency at which ependymal cilia beat by adding the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin, which we have previously shown to reduce ependymal CBF [4] . The ciliaFA program has been made freely available and may be downloaded in Additional file 1.",
