    "text": "In response to shared conservation issues that threaten bat populations, bat research has expanded from predominantly short-term, independent projects to sustained collaborative networks that provide training in skills that strengthen bat conservation efforts, from taxonomy to ecology and educational outreach to policy formulation [21] . Numerous regional networks of bat research experts have been established around the world [4, 21] (Figure 1 ). There are a number of advantages that coordinated, regional bat research initiatives have over country-specific efforts, specifically the ability to take effective action on shared threats spanning geographical, temporal, and disciplinary scales [21] . Bats are highly mobile, and often have geographic distributions that extend across political boundaries. Without regional collaborations, conservation efforts in one country may be insufficient to counteract the threats towards a species elsewhere in its range [57] . In just the same way, viruses with mobile hosts can be easily spread across borders and require cooperation among a broad array of experts to ensure the reduced risk of spillover and spread [78] . Moreover, bats are long-lived and therefore require long-term studies that can withstand funding shortages and changes in government priorities and policies [21] . Finally, bats are ecologically and taxonomically diverse, and known reservoir hosts for a diverse range of viruses with zoonotic potential [34] . How, then, can zoonotic disease surveillance programs best leverage the expertise of bat ecologists and conservationists to more fully understand the basic ecology of host species? Furthermore, in return, how can bat experts learn from disease experts to understand the role of human threats in altering host-virus dynamics? [21] and network websites.",
