    "text": "The procedure was performed as previously described [16] . Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay. 5 μg protein from whole-cell lysates were solubilized in 5× SDS sample buffer and separated on SDS 10 % polyacrylamide gels. Blots were incubated with antibodies against c-Jun, PDK1, EP4, GAPDH, and phosphorylated PDK1 (c-Jun, PDK1, pPDK1 and EP4 in the concentrations of 1:1,000 for 2 h; GAPDH in the concentration of 1:10000 for 1 h) at room temperature. After washing several times, the blots were followed by incubation with a secondary goat antibody raised against rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:2,000; Santa Cruz). The blots were washed, transferred to fresh chemiluminescence solution (Amersham) for about 1-2 min, and exposed to X-ray film. In controls, the primary antibodies were omitted or replaced with a control rabbit IgG. for Western blot and cell growth and gel mobility shift assays.",
