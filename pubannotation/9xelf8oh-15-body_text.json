    "text": "All unknown sample extracts were run in triplicate with one NTC for each sample using the optimised qPCR protocol. Each reaction plate contained (1) a positive control for the target genes, (2) a standardised calibrator sample (1 × 10 7 copies of reference and target genes made up to 200 ng total DNA using λ DNA) and (3) a triplicate of a standard of known quantities of all assay genes. See Online Resource S4 for the layout of a typical sample plate. One standard curve (imported during software analysis) was used for analysis of several qPCR plates, rather than making a standard curve for each plate (allowing more samples per plate); this allowed the standard within the plate to act as a reference on the standard curve while the calibrator acted as a reference for inter-plate variation (see normalisation calculation below). The mean C p value was converted to a copy number and a normalised relative quantitative ratio (RQ) of the target gene to reference gene was then calculated using the following equation:",
