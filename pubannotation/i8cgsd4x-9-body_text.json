    "text": "The proteasomal pathway plays an important role post-viral entry A previous report suggests the proteasomal pathway has a role during entry of WNV into mammalian cells [25] . To test this in the mosquito system, Hsu cells were pre-treated with MG132 at various concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 μM), infected with WNV (MOI 10) at 4°C for 30 min and then incubated at 30°C. Real-time RT-qPCR using NS1 primers conducted on total RNA from cells collected at 6 hpi showed no significant effect of MG132 treatment, indicating that the proteasome does not play a role during WNV entry to Culex cells (Fig 2C) . To determine whether the proteasomal pathway plays significant role post-entry, cells were infected with WNV and treated with 10 μM MG132 from 2, 4, or 6 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR using NS1 primers conducted on total RNA from cells collected at 48 hpi showed~80% reduction in viral RNA in all treated samples ( Fig 2D) . Experiments were also performed to rule out significant contribution by extracellular viral RNA in real time RT-qPCR results (S2 Fig). These results suggest involvement of the proteasomal pathway post-viral entry, possibly during viral transcription.",
