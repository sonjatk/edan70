    "text": "As shown in Fig. 4c , the proteins involved in the stimulus-response were enriched, and most of them are reported to respond to viral infection. These proteins can be potential targets for controlling viral infection. Dynamic changes in the expressed proteins in cluster B were noted. They were initially down-regulated at 12 and 24 hpi, followed by a rapid return to near basal levels at 36 hpi and slight up-regulation at 48 and 60 hpi. Thus, 12 and 24 hpi were the best time points to study these proteins (Fig. 4) .",
