    "text": "For ependymal cilia the mean CBF was 36.3 ± 6.4 Hz for the direct counting and 35.9 ± 7.0 Hz for the ciliaFA method. For respiratory cilia the mean CBF was 11.72 ± 2.8 Hz for the direct counting and 11.97 ± 3.0 Hz for the ciliaFA method. The Bland-Altman limits showed agreement from −2.55 to 3.25 Hz for the ependymal cilia and showed a closer agreement for the respiratory cilia (−1.99 to 1.49 Hz).",
