    "text": "The Eurasian red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris) in the UK, has suffered a severe reduction in its abundance and distribution (Bosch and Lurz 2012) , coinciding with the introduction of the non-native Eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) in the 1900s (Gurnell and Pepper 1993; Usher et al. 1992) . A combination of modelling (Rushton et al. 2006; Tompkins et al. 2003) , experimental infection studies (Tompkins et al. 2002) and field data (Chantrey et al. 2014) indicates that a major part of the decline of UK red squirrel populations is due to infection by squirrelpox virus (SQPV). This pathogen is thought to have been introduced with the grey squirrel, a theory supported by a high prevalence of exposure despite an absence of clinical disease (Bruemmer et al. 2010; Sainsbury et al. 2000) , an association between seropositive grey squirrels and the appearance of clinical cases of squirrelpox in red squirrels (McInnes et al. , 2013 Sainsbury et al. 2008) and an association of the pathogen in both squirrel species during an outbreak of disease in red squirrels (Chantrey et al. 2014 ). Programmes to reintroduce red squirrels in the UK have been hampered by disease: by SQPV in Norfolk (Carroll et al. 2009 ) and adenovirus in squirrels (SADV) in other areas of the UK (Everest et al. 2008 (Everest et al. , 2012b Martinez-Jimenez et al. 2011 ). SADV appears to cause mortality in wild red squirrels (Duff et al. 2007; Everest et al. 2012a ), although the impact on a population scale is largely unknown with subclinical infections also reported (Everest et al. 2014) .",
