    "text": "To summarize, existing methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures suffer from one or both of the following shortcomings: 1) slow running time, or 2) poor prediction accuracy. Moreover there is limited opportunity for the user to provide structural information, or constraints, that can guide prediction. In cases of a prediction method that incorporates user-defined constraints, it is also useful to understand the degree to which the method's accuracy persists as the input information degrades. We use the term robustness with respect to partial information or robustness to refer to this property of a method. (We note that in our definition of robustness we do not mean robust with respect to noise.) To the best of our knowledge, the concept of robustness in secondary structure prediction methods has not been studied before.",
