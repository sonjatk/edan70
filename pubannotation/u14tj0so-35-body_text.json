    "text": "HFold-PKonly: Given an RNA sequence, S, and a pseudoknot-free input structure, G, find a pseudoknotfree structure, G such that every base pair in G crosses some base pair of G and such that G âˆª G is the lowest energy structure that contains G among all such G s. Note that G may contain no base pairs. Iterative HFold also uses the SimFold RNA secondary structure prediction method [63] , which predicts the minimum free energy pseudoknot-free secondary structure for a given RNA sequence. SimFold uses a dynamic programming method similar to Zuker's MFold method [64] . In this work we used the HotKnots energy parameters when running SimFold. In addition to an RNA sequence, S, SimFold can also take a pseudoknot-free secondary structure, G, as input and predict the MFE pseudoknotfree secondary structure that contains all base pairs of G.",
