    "text": "To simulate a cough, aerosol injections were employed right at the mouth of the index patient. According to experimental measurements of cough droplets, the quantity of the droplets smaller than 3 μm was quite small, and the droplets larger than 100 μm might fall down to the ground immediately after they were expelled [33, 34] . So in this work, the original size range of the aerosols was 3 μm~112 μm and ten size classes were used to simulate the size distribution. In enclosed environment, the evaporation effects will strongly influence the size and mass of the droplets [32] . Considering that the equilibrium diameter after evaporation was 50% of the original size [35] , the size range of the aerosol injections was 1.5~56 μm and the size distribution followed the experimental results given by Duguid [34] . The particles number of each size class was set as 50,000 and the total number of the particles of the ten size classes was 500, 000, follows the aerosol setup used by previous studies [18, 22] . The total volume of this computational geometry is larger than that of Reference [22] (30 m 3 ) and smaller than that of Reference [18] (97 m 3 ), thus the total number of the particles used in this numerical simulation can be considered as enough for this study. This number would be converted to the original number according to the size distribution of cough for infection risk assessment. The size distribution of the droplets used in the numerical simulation is shown in Table 3 . The coughing direction was 45 degree downwards (0, 1, −1). When the index patient coughs, the open area of his mouth was 9.68 cm 2 . The velocity of the exhaled airflow was set according to the experimental results to approximately simulate a cough [19] .",
