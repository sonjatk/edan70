    "text": "Transgenic mice that express HCV proteins have been generated to study HCV expression [3, 4] ; however, in each of these cases, the relevant transgenes is expressed during embryonic development; therefore, the transgenic mice become immunotolerant to the transgenic products, and consequently, the adult mice are not useful for investigations of the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis C. To address this problem, we developed a system that can drive conditional expression of an HCV transgene; our system involves the Cre/loxP system and a recombinant adenovirus capable of expressing Cre recombinase [5, 6] . Concerns have been expressed that an adenovirus and transient expression of HCV proteins could induce immune responses [5] and, therefore, obscure any evidence of the effect of the host immune responses on chronic liver pathology. Therefore, here, we used a Cre/loxP switching system to generate an immunocompetent mouse model of HCV protein expression; with this system, we could study the host immune responses against HCV proteins. Folgori et al. (2006) reported effective vaccination of chimpanzees with an adenoviral vector and plasmid DNA encoding the HCV nonstructural region. This technique protected the liver tissues from acute hepatitis, which results when whole animals are challenged with virus [7] . However, this vaccine has not yet been shown to be effective against chronic HCV infection.",
