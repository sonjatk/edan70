    "text": "SADV infection also appears to be localised in grey squirrels, with the highest level of infection detected in rectal swab samples (RQ mean = 0.0009 ± 0.001 CI, n = 8), with 0.88 (7/8, 0.47-0.99 CI) of infected individuals showing presence of the virus on such swabs (Fig. 2c) . However, tissue samples from the gastrointestinal tract (i.e. stomach, large intestine and faeces) yielded low numbers of the virus (e.g. small intestine RQ mean = 0.00009 ± 0.0001 CI, n = 8) and with only a quarter (0.25 (2/8), 0.05-0.64 CI) of the infected grey squirrels showing a positive result in the small intestinal tissue. Interestingly, values of RQ in the spleen were somewhat higher (RQ mean = 0.0007 ± 0.0009 CI, n = 8), with viral presence in half (0.5 (4/8), 0.18-0.82 CI) of the SADV-positive animals. The findings in the spleen are also complemented with a high proportion of viral presence in the blood (0.86 (6/7), 0.42-0.99 CI, n = 7) all-be-it with relatively low quantity of virus (RQ mean = 0.0003 ± 0.0002 CI, n = 7). All other samples/tissues showed a low prevalence of infection (≤0.13 (1/8), 0.01-0.53 CI) (Fig. 2c) . ",
