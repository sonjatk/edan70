    "text": "In order for models to be used to predict the potential for disease spread in livestock, there is reliance upon accurate data regarding farm locations and movements of livestock between farms. Significant work has been done in the UK to predict the potential for disease spread through the livestock network [12, 17, 18] owing to the existence of the CTS and the animal movement licence scheme. In many other countries around the world, the lack of such databases means that it is impossible to develop a model that uses precise movement data, and an alternative approach must be used. In such countries, it may be impossible to ever record all movement data either owing to the sheer size of the industry (in countries such as the USA) or owing to the cost associated with implementing an animal licence scheme. However, a more limited data collection scheme may be possible, whereby movements are recorded for a subset of the livestock movement network.",
