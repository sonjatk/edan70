    "text": "Multiplex assay performance was further quantified using necropsy tissue samples with the aim of quantifying the infection load of tissues from red squirrel carcasses found during autumn 2011. Some squirrels were suspected to have SQPVor SADV based on gross lesions (skin ulcers or enteritis, respectively), while three red squirrels had no sign of disease (i.e. road casualties) and three red squirrels were selected on the basis that they had gross lesions not traditionally associated with either SQPV or SADV (skin or gastrointestinal inflammation, respectively). As grey squirrels rarely show clinical signs for either infection, 16 carcases were selected at random from samples submitted as part of a grey squirrel control programme (during autumn 2011). All squirrels had a systematic necropsy examination. Swabs (Dacron tip, Fisher Scientific UK Ltd., Loughborough, UK) were taken from sites believed to have a predilection for SQPV infection (i.e. oral/lip, eyelid and/or arm vibrissae) (Atkin et al. 2010) or SADV enteric infection (rectum). Corresponding skin samples were taken, along with flank and chest (vibrissae) skin samples for grey squirrels and nose, ear, digit, inguinal and genital skin samples for red squirrels. Submandibular lymph node, lung, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, stomach, small intestine (duodenum and jejunum), large intestine (caecum and colon), faeces, skeletal muscle and brain were all sampled. Blood was collected postmortem and serum was separated from the cell pellet by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 10 min). All samples were stored at −20°C until DNA purification using a DNeasy® blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) and the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was extracted from swabs using protocol (a) in the Online Resource S5. DNA was isolated from the blood cell pellet using a FlexiGene DNA kit (Qiagen, Manchester, UK) following the protocol (b) in the Online Resource S5. A 'no sample' DNA extraction was completed in tandem with every batch of extractions to monitor potential contamination during DNA extractions.",
