    "text": "This 'defense' model to explain macro-PARP evolution, combined with the importance of virally encoded macrodomains for the fitness of several RNA viruses, allows us to generate a mechanistic hypothesis for the conflict that may have driven the rapid evolution of macro-PARP genes. In our model, ADP-ribosylation functions as a post-translational modification of either host or viral factors ( Figure 5A ). We posit that macro-PARP proteins are recruited to sites of ADP-ribosylation by their macrodomains, most of which are predicted to be able to recognize, but not remove ADP-ribose ( Figure S5 ), to exert either direct antiviral functions or recruit other antiviral factors. Recruitment of catalytically active macro-PARP genes could also facilitate further ADP-ribosylation of target proteins, allowing macro-PARP proteins to rapidly 'amplify' an initial signal of ADPr. Such a model of amplification by recruitment and additional ADP-ribosylation by PARP proteins has been seen at sites of DNA damage, where PARP1 activation by ADPr leads to increased ADP-ribosylation [7, 8] . We hypothesize that some viruses have overcome this macro-PARP-mediated antiviral response by direct antagonism of macro-PARP proteins ( Figure 5B ). Such antagonism could drive the rapid evolution we see in several regions of the macro-PARP genes, including but not limited to the macrodomains. However, other viruses, such as togaviruses and coronaviruses, have evolved their own macrodomains to either cleave ADP-ribose ( Figure 5C ) or compete with macro-PARP proteins ( Figure 5D ), in order to overcome the effects of the macro-PARP proteins. Although speculative, our model provides testable hypotheses about the genetic and physical interactions between PARP macrodomains, viral macrodomains, and ADP-ribose, and their consequences in terms of determining outcomes of viral infections in cells.",
