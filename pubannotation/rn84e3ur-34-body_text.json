    "text": "The walking person also has a non-negligible exposure level. Figure 7 gives a thirty-second time profile of the relative intake dose of the moving person for moving speeds of 0.5 m/s and 1.0 m/s (case 2 and 3). As shown in Figure 7 , the relative intake dose of the moving person increases quickly after the person starts to move (t â‰¥ 1 s). The peak value appears at t = 5 s and t = 3 s for case 2 and 3, corresponding to a moving distance of 2 m, where the moving person is quite close to the index patient. Figure 7 also indicates a high relative intake dose during the movement (t = 2.5~7 s for 0.5 m/s and t = 25 s for 1.0 m/s), when the moving person walks through the region with high aerosol concentration (row 6-11). So a passenger or a crew member will receive a high intake dose if he/she walks through the aisle when the index patient is coughing.",
