    "text": "Novel cases of SADV are reported in this study also. All three red squirrels that had died from causes other than skin lesions, gastrointestinal lesions or road causalities showed evidence of SADV infection. The two squirrels with severe pediculosis had SADV consistently identified in multiple tissue types, albeit at relatively low levels. The cause of death of these two squirrels was thought to be due to anaemia, It should be noted that the swab/blood samples appear to be superior to tissue samples in all instances apart from adenovirus in red squirrels when using the qPCR developed in this study secondary to parasitism (Duff et al. 2010; Larose et al. 2010; Simpson et al. 2013b ). However, haemorrhage has been reported in 70 % (7/10) of case studies of SADV infection (Martinez-Jimenez et al. 2011) . The prevalence of SADV in lice found on infected individuals was 80 % (4/5: 95 % CI, 30-99 %), which combined with the relatively high occurrence of viral DNA in blood (67 % (6/9); 95 % CI 31-91 %) may suggest a potential role of the parasite in pathogen transmission. Additionally, the red squirrel that had pneumonia also showed SADV DNA presence in all tissues analysed. The lung RQ value was the highest recorded in any infected individual (12.52), and, indeed, viral prevalence in lung tissue was relatively common in infected individuals (64 %, 7/11; 95 % CI, 32-88 %) (Fig. 3) .",
