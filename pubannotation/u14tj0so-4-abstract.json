    "text": "Currently computational RNA structure prediction methods mainly focus on predicting RNA secondary structure-the set of base pairs that form when RNA molecules fold. When multiple homologous (evolutionarily related) RNA sequences are available, the secondary structure of the sequences can be predicted using multiple sequence alignment and comparative sequence analysis [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Alternative approaches, which can be used to predict secondary structure of a single sequence, are",
