    "text": "Iterative HFold is distinguished from the above three methods, namely HFold, HFold-PKonly and SimFold, in two important ways. First, the output of HFold, HFold-PKonly and SimFold methods must contain the given pseudoknot-free input structure, G, whereas Iterative HFold may modify the input structure. This can be useful when the given input structure is not a high-accuracy estimate of G big , the true pseudoknot-free substructure of the reference structure. Second, while HFold and HFold-PKonly can add base pairs that cross those in G, they cannot add base pairs that cross each other, and neither can SimFold. In contrast, Iterative HFold can add base pairs that cross each other. This is particularly useful when the input structure contains limited information about G big , and so it is necessary both to predict base pairs in G big and in G small in order to get a good prediction.",
