    "text": "For comparisons with other methods already in the literature, we choose to use our Iterative HFold method with HotKnots hotspots as input structure, based on its overall good accuracies in Section 'Accuracy comparison of different versions of HFold'. We compare this method with two of the best-performing methods [44] for prediction of pseudoknotted structures, namely HotKnots V2.0 [36] , a MFE-based heuristic method, and IPknot [42] , a method that is based on maximum expected accuracy. (Prepared by Puton et al. [44] , CompaRNA, is the website for continuous comparison of RNA secondary structure methods on both PDB data set and RNA strand. We chose IPknot because it was the best-performing noncomparative pseudoknot prediction method that can handle long RNA sequences, based on the ranking on their website as of March 25, 2014 . We also noticed that Puton et al. used HotKnots V1 for their comparison, and not the more recently available and better performing Hot-Knots V2.0. Therefore we chose to include HotKnots in our comparisons as well. Since the focus of this paper is on prediction of pseudoknotted structures, we do not compare our results with that of Co-Fold [26] or other methods for prediction of pseudoknot free structures.) Table 3 presents the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval of average F-measure for Iterative HFold with hotspots as input, HotKnots V2.0, Sim-Fold and IPknot with default setting (see Section 'Accuracy comparison tests') on the HK-PK and HK-PKfree data sets. For pseudoknotted structures, our permutation tests show that the difference in accuracy of Iterative HFold and HotKnots is not significant. However, the superior accuracy of Iterative HFold compared with SimFold and IPknot is significant. For pseudoknotfree structures, the difference in accuracy between IPknot, Iterative HFold, HotKnots and SimFold is not significant. Table 4 presents the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval for average F-measure for Iterative HFold (with hotspots as input), HotKnots and IPknot (with default setting) on the IP-pk168 and DK-pk16 data sets.",
