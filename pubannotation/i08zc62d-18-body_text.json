    "text": "Neu5Ac seems to be responsible for inducing the conformational change of Ile327. Cp-NanI CD in complex with diplacone has the same side-chain orientation of Asp291 as in the substrate (Neu5Ac) complex. In addition, an extra water molecule (W1) rather than the 4 0 -hydroxyl group of Neu5Ac stabilizes the diplacone complex. Therefore, together with the kinetic inhibition assay, the structure of the Cp-NanI CDdiplacone complex suggests that diplacone binds to the same substrate-binding site and acts as a competitive inhibitor.",
