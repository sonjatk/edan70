    "text": "Cells cultured in 60 mm dish were transfected in triplicate with respective plasmids. Control samples were transfected with EGFP expression plasmid (pSGI-EGFP). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde and ChIP assay was performed as described elsewhere [24] . Forward and reverse primer sequences for amplification of MHC-I heavy chain promoter were 5 0 CAGGGAGT CCAGTTCAGGGA 3 0 and 5 0 TGAGTCCGGGTGGGTGC GTG 3 0 , respectively and for amplification of IL-8 promoter were 5 0 GGGCCATCAGTTGCAAA TC 3 0 and 5 0 TTCCT TCCGGTGGTTTCTTC 3 0 , respectively.",
