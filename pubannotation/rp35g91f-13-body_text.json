We performed sample correlation in the BXD data set and returned the top 100 significantly correlated transcripts (Supplemental Material, Table S1 in File S2; P , 0.0005). This set of 100 transcripts was enriched for genes known to be associated with cardiac muscle function, including structural proteins (actin and myosin), ion transporters (ryanodine receptors, calcium, and potassium transporters), and transcription factors (Hand2 and Nkx2-5). To define genes within this list that were likely to act in a concerted manner in the pulmonary myocardium, we generated a network graph and found 24 transcripts that were significantly associated at a Pearson correlation .0.8. These 24 transcripts were subsequently regraphed with lower stringency to visualize potential relationships between them ( Figure 1A ). Three transcripts (Tnnt2, Pln, and Kcnj3) were detected by two separate probes and thus the 24 transcripts corresponded to only 21 unique genes. All 21 genes have previously been reported to be expressed in cardiac muscle (Chopra and Knollmann 2013; Ding et al. 2010; Fukuda and Mikoshiba 2000; Greulich et al. 2011; Guo et al. 2013; Hennessey et al. 2013; Holmegard et al. 2010; Huh et al. 2012; Marx et al. 2000; Reiser et al. 2001; Sequeira et al. 2015; Shaikh et al. 2016; Stobdan et al. 2015; Takeda et al. 2003; Warren et al. 2012; Yamashita et al. 2003; Zhou and Wu 2014) ( Figure 1B and Table 1 ); all were highly significantly correlated with Tnni3 (P , 3.02e 28 ). These genes can be loosely clustered into functional categories including structural sarcomeric proteins, regulation of sarcomere assembly, ion transport, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, and hormone signaling (Table 1) .",
