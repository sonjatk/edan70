    "text": "RSV and influenza virus are known to occur in welldefined recurrent epidemics during the cold season in temperate climates [1, 2] . In tropical and subtropical areas, RSV infections have been reported to peak more often in relation to the wet season, but locations close to the equator show a less consistent pattern, some with almost continuous RSV activity and varying seasonal peaks [1, 7] . Studies in the Indian subcontinent have reported RSV infections to peak both in the cold season [27] and in the rainy season [35, 36] , as well as being detectable throughout the year [35, 37] . We observed RSV epidemics both in winter and during the monsoon. The virus was isolated during a period of 6 to 7 months and the epidemic peaks were observed with intervals of 15 and 9 months, which is consistent with patterns described elsewhere [31, 38] .",
