    "text": "The availability of appropriate MERS-CoV-specific immune monitoring tools is a prerequisite for the successful development of vaccines and therapeutic approaches. The development of these tools is hampered by the fact that we still know little about the relevant viral antigens and the overall pathogenesis of the MERS-CoV infection. Recent studies describe a number of cases with asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection in humans and raise questions as to which factors influence the clinical manifestation of MERS [52, 53] . Since asymptomatic or mild clinical manifestations of MERS-CoV infection are often associated with low levels of seropositivity, the analysis of MERS-CoV-specific cellular immune responses may facilitate further insight into the immune correlates of disease prevention. Moreover, in order to characterize the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection, it will be indispensable to monitor the role of virus-specific T cells in animal models of MERS and to precisely identify the antigen specificities of these T cell responses.",
