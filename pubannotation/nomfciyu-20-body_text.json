    "text": "Recently, interest has been generated in the development of peptide therapeutics as potential drug targets for different pathogens. Currently, more than 140 peptide therapeutics are lined up for clinical evaluation presenting peptide research as a component of pharmaceutical research [80] . As compared with chemical drugs, peptide drugs show high specificity toward the target as well as little side effect and drug tolerance [19] . Many peptide therapeutics have shown positive results against viral infections, for instance RVFV-6 peptide against rift valley fever virus and Kn2-7 peptide derived from scorpion venom against HIV-1 [81] [82] [83] . Antimicrobial peptides are cited as potential novel antiviral therapeutics against coronaviruses [84] . Antimicrobial peptides are produced by host immune system upon initial exposure to pathogens. These are gene encoded and positively charged peptides that are selectively toxic against their targets [85, 86] . This selectivity is due to their positive charge which attacks the negatively charged membrane bilayer of microbes [87] . The antimicrobial peptides block the receptors present on the host cell's surface, which in turn inhibit different steps of viral fusion and replication causing virolysis and activation of host's adaptive immune response [88] .",
