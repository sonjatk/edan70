    "text": "We found that the HSP60 expression level was increased at 60 hpi. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a group of proteins that respond to stress, including heat, hypoxia, irradiation, infection, or toxic agents 46 . HSP has been shown to influence apoptosis in tumour cells, regulate p53 function, and induce an immune response to tumours 47 . Increased HSP levels make cells more resistant to apoptosis, but they also can increase immunity to cancer 48 . For example, over-expressed HSP60 protein is suggested to promote prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and primary breast cancer; for these cancers, HSP60 inhibitors may be used as anti-cancer agents [49] [50] [51] . Whereas, a loss of HSP60 immunopositivity is related to the development and progression of bronchial cancer in smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 52 . In this experiment, we also identified that the HSP70 expression level was increased at 60 hpi and the HSP90A expression level was decreased at 48 hpi and 60 hpi. As the influence of the HSP expression changes due to different cancers, the anti-cancer significance of the differential expression of HSPs in CPV-infected cells is complicated and requires further study.",
