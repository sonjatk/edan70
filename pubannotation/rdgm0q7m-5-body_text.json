    "text": "Through reconstitution of the PRRSV −2/−1 PRF signal in vitro, we show here that in addition to the viral transactivator nsp1␤, efficient frameshifting requires the participation of cellular poly(C) binding proteins (PCBPs). In mammalian cells, two PCBP subsets have been described, hnRNPs K/J (21) and the ␣CP proteins ␣CP1 and ␣CP2, often referred to as PCBP1 and PCBP2 (22, 23) . The latter group also includes the more recently described paralogues PCBP3 and PCBP4 (24) . PCBPs are members of the KH domain superfamily of nucleic acid binding proteins and have a wide spectrum of biological activities, including the regulation of RNA splicing, the stabilization of cellular and viral mRNAs, transcriptional activation and inhibition, and translational silencing and enhancement (reviewed in Refs. 25, 26) . Using in vitro translation and RNA binding assays, we demonstrate that a complex of nsp1␤ and PCBP binds to the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence and mimics the action of the more typical RNA pseudoknot stimulators of programmed frameshifting. This unprecedented frameshift-stimulatory signal provides new insights as to how the ribosomal elongation cycle can be modified by trans-acting protein factors. Further, it broadens the repertoire of activities associated with poly(C) binding proteins and prototypes a new class of virus-host interactions.",
