    "text": "The purpose of this study was to analyze serum protein levels using iTRAQ in normal controls, as well as patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and HBV-induced ACLF, and to verify those results using western blotting. The ultimate aim was to identify the differences in serum protein levels that were closely associated with the progression of hepatitis B and HBV-induced ACLF. The results of this study may provide crucial information regarding viral mechanisms and the pathogenic process.",
