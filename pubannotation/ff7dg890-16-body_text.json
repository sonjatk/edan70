    "text": "for the SEIR model with gamma-distributed latent and infectious periods (further details are given in Protocol S1). This equation translates into an expression for R 0 in terms of k and the other parameters, as is presented in equation 4. Therefore, if we can estimate the growth rate k from data, we can use equation 4 to obtain an estimate of R 0 .",
