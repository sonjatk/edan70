    "text": "Nurse (N1) indicated that: \"It is sad the way TB is spreading in our communities, we have a record of patients who come from one family or who are related. They decide to infect others or share their sputum just for them to get a TB grant. When they realize that they are recovering, they default for the social grant to continue. Most of those patients, when they come back to the hospitals, they will be MDR or XDR; they do not survive. Some MDR or XDR TB patients infect one another in the TB ward.\" Nurse (N6) had this to say: \"Patients also spread disease when they use public transport. They go to church and when they are in shopping complex. Each time I hear of TB outbreak in the communities I get stressed because I see large number of people who are still going to die of TB. We feel vulnerable because in the whole community we are the first people in the line of danger.\"",
