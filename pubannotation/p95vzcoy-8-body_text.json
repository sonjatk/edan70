    "text": "Fifteen M. rubra colonies, collected in their founding stage around Berlin, Germany, were purchased from https://www.antstore.net/shop/de [50] . These colonies were kept in nesting tubes (155 mm length, 14 inner diameters) and fed with Drosophila hydei and sugar-water ad libitum (40% mass fraction of sugar). For the experiment, the colonies were transferred into boxes (60 × 70 × 15 mm) attached to a foraging arena (200 × 150 × 120 mm). Humidity in the nest was maintained with a moist cotton ball. Red foil covered the nest boxes to reduce stress [51] . The foraging arenas had an opening covered with removable insect nets and the edges were covered with paraffin oil to minimize escape. The colonies were maintained at RT (19-23 • C) with a natural day/night cycle.",
