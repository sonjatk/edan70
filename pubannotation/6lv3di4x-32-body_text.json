All procedures which involve animals performed at the Institute of Virology and Immunology (IVI) comply with the Animal Welfare Act (TSchG SR 455), the Animal Welfare Ordinance (TSchV SR 455.1), and the Animal Experimentation Ordinance (TVV SR 455.163) of Switzerland. All studies were reviewed by the ethical committee for animal experiments of the canton of Bern, Switzerland, and approved by the cantonal veterinary authorities (Amt für Landwirtschaft und Natur, Veterinärdienst). Blood sampling was approved with license number BE88/14. Nasal mucosa was obtained in the context of regular slaughter of pigs at the slaughterhouse of the IVI. The pigs were not slaughtered for the purpose of organ collection. Consent for collecting samples after slaughter was obtained from the animal facility manager of the IVI.

First, 600 l per well of basolateral supernatants from JEV-infected porcine NEC were harvested at 72 hpi and dispensed into 24-well plates. Next, 10 6 monocytes were added into Transwell inserts with 3-m-diameter pores (Becton, Dickinson) and placed in the wells filled with the porcine NEC culture-derived basolateral medium. After 3 h of incubation at 39°C and 5% CO 2 , basolateral medium was harvested and total monocytes were harvested and quantified. Monocyte phenotype was verified by immunolabeling with anti-porcine CD14 (MIL2; Bio-Rad). Controls included ALI medium, medium collected from mock-treated porcine NEC, and porcine CCL2 (200 pg/ml in ALI medium; Kingfisher Biotech, St. Paul, MN). For monocyte quantification by flow cytometry, CountBright absolute counting beads (Thermo Fisher) were used following the manufacturer's manual. Dead cells were excluded by electronic gating in forward/side scatter plots, followed by exclusion of doublets.",
