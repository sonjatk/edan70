    "text": "In addition, comparative immune studies were performed with optimised plasmids encoding the prME sequence of either a recently identified Brazilian ZIKV strain or of the original MR766 ZIKV strain. Induction of cellular immune responses in mice immunised with either plasmid was measured 1 week after the third vaccination through IFN-γ ELISpot analysis after stimulating splenocytes with the ZIKV-prME peptide pools. The results illustrate that the T-cell responses induced by the consensus ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine construct were consistently higher than those generated by either of these two non-consensus Figure 2 . Characterisation of cellular immune responses in mice following vaccination with the ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine. (a) Timeline of vaccine immunisations and immune analysis used in the study. (b) ELISpot analysis measuring IFN-γ secretion in splenocytes in response to ZIKV-prME immunisation. C57BL/6 mice (n = 4/group) were immunised i.m. three times with 25 μg of either pVax1 or the ZIKV-prME DNA vaccine followed by electroporation. IFN-γ generation, as an indication of induction of cellular immune responses, was measured by an IFN-γ ELISpot assay. The splenocytes harvested 1 week after the third immunisation were incubated in the presence of one of the six peptide pools spanning the entire prM and Env proteins. Results are shown in stacked bar graphs. The data represent the average numbers of SFU (spotforming units) per million splenocytes with values representing the mean responses in each ± s.e.m. (c) Epitope composition of the ZIKV-prME-specific IFN-γ response as determined by stimulation with matrix peptide pools 1 week after the third immunisation. The values represent mean responses in each group ± s.e.m. The experiments were performed independently at least three times with similar results. (d) Flow cytometric analysis of T-cell responses. Immunisation with ZIKV-prME induces higher number of IFN-γ and TNF-α secreting cells when stimulated by ZIKV peptides. One week after the last immunisation with the ZIKV-prME vaccine, splenocytes were cultured in the presence of pooled ZIKV peptides (5 μM) or R10 only. Frequencies of ZIKV peptide-specific IFN-γ and TNF-α secreting cells were measured by flow cytometry. Single function gates were set based on negative control (unstimulated) samples and were placed consistently across samples. The percentage of the total CD8 + T-cell responses are shown. These data are representative of two independent immunisation experiments. IFN, interferon; TNF, tumour necrosis factor; ZIKV-prME, precursor membrane and Env of Zika virus.",
