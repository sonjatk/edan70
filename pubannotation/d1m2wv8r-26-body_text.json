    "text": "Using Metacore TM software, we were able to suggest the main pathways related to CPV infection. Interestingly, a pathway that involved the degradation of CFTR was significantly enriched in our study. CFTR is a transmembrane protein that functions as an ATP-gated chloride channel 53 . Deficiency in CFTR can lead to several diseases related to the reduction of chloride secretion and the increase of sodium uptake 54 . Many studies have suggested that wound healing function is impaired in CFTR-deficient epithelial cells and that CFTR may be effective in cell repair after injury 18, 55, 56 . CPV is normally cytopathic in infected F81 cells. Typical CPEs appear as a mesh of monolayer cells prompted by detached cells. These results provided us hints that CPV may trigger CFTR deficiency and influence the cell pathological change by reducing the wound healing of infected cells.",
