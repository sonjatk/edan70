    "text": "Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a positive single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Picornavirudae family. EV71 together with Coxsackievirus 16 (CVA16), CVA5, and CVA10, are known to be major causative agents that cause mild rash symptoms called hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) in infants and children [1] . Since 1997 a significant increase of EV71 epidemics has been observed throughout the Asian-Pacific region [2] . In the 1998 EV71 outbreak in Taiwan, over 100 000 young children were infected, and approximately 400 children were hospitalized with severe pulmonary and neurogenic complications that resulted in 78 deaths [3, 4] .",
