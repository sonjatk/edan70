    "text": "Within the CNS, LGTV mainly infected neurons [99, 128] , which is also the case in lethal TBEV infection of humans [142] . Although neurons remain the main target cell of TBEV, astrogliosis have been shown in post mortem human brains [142, 143] . In vitro studies on primary cortical astrocytes show a fast up regulation and secretion of IFN after TBEV infection, which is able to protect neighboring astrocytes and neurons from infection already 6 and 3 h post infection, respectively [100] . Astrocytes have been shown to be resistant to TBEV-induced cytopathic effects [144, 145] , and it was later shown that IFNAR expression protected the astrocytes from the virus-induced cytopathic effects [100] . Pretreatment of cells with IFNs strongly inhibits growth of most TBFVs in cell culture [100, 103, [146] [147] [148] [149] and this is due to the upregulation and concerted actions of several hundreds of ISGs. Only a few ISGs have been identified to play a role in TBEV and LGTV infection [86, 141, 147, 149, 150] . One of them, the 2 -5 -oligoadenylate synthetase (2 -5 -OAS) (OAS) is activated by double-stranded RNA, leading to the OAS protein polymerization into 2 -5 -linked oligoadenylates (2-5As) [151, 152] . These 2-5As activate RNase L, resulting in the degradation of viral RNA [153] . Several polymorphisms in the OAS genes have been shown to correlate with severe forms of TBE in patients [154] . Also, the murine isoform Oas1b, which is often lacking in inbred mice strains, confers strain dependent resistance against neurovirulence from far eastern TBEV [155] . Two other ISGs which have been shown to be antivirally active against TBEV are virus inhibitory protein endoplasmic reticulum associated interferon inducible (viperin) and tripartite motif-79α (TRIM79α).",
