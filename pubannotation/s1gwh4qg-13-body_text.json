    "text": "The availability of description for characteristics in a particular set of entries from databases is a major factor determining how well names designed with SNAD match expectation. The amount and accuracy of annotation in sequence databases vary markedly between entries that has been a major concern for the bioinformatics community continuously working toward improving this critical aspect of sequence databases [7, 8, 27] . Involving other researchers in this effort, especially those who submit original sequence annotation in the first place, could accelerate the process. We hope that through using SNAD service, researchers could see immediate benefits from better annotation for their research that may create impetus for contributing quality annotation to public databases. To improve the user experience with SNAD, we plan to expand the diversity of databases and templates upon future upgrades of SNAD. Any template that the users designed and considered useful could be included in the future SNAD releases.",
