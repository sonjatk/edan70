    "text": "As the percentage of nodes sampled decreases, the number of movements and nodes captured is observed to decrease for all sampling methods (figure 1). As the network fragments, the size of the GSCC decreases while the number of strongly connected components increases. Both the TNS and SBS sampling schemes outperform the RNS scheme in preserving robustness across all measured statistics as the percentage of nodes sampled decreases (figure 1). Within the giant component, the mean degree and degree standard deviation remain robust with approximately 15-20% of the data for both TNS and SBS.",
