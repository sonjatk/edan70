    "text": "The hSCARB2-transgemic mice were bred and maintained as previously described [11] . Both 1-day and 7-day old mice were inoculated with 1610 7 pfu of live E59 and 3610 5 pfu live 5746 virus isolates subcutaneously (s.c.). For protection studies, the purified neutralizing monoclonal antibody N3 (20 ml of 10 mg/ mL) were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) into the mice after 3, 24, and 48 h after infection. Mice were observed for symptom development for 10 days post virus infection. The severity of HFMD-like and paralysis symptoms was scored from 0 to 5 using the following criteria: For HFMD-like symptoms 5 = 80% hair loss associated with scurf (white spots) (HLS), 4 = 50% HLS, 3 = .30% HLS, 2 = .10% HLS, 1 = ,10% HLS and 0 = no HLS on the back and abdomen. To score the degree of paralysis, 5 = severe RNA was extracted from the brain, spinal cord, and muscles of 5746-infected 7-day old hSCARB2-transgenic mice treated with N3 or isotype antibody, and antibody-untreated mice as described in Fig. 4 and were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR specific to (A) IFN-a, (B) IFN-b, and (C) IFN-c. The relative expression of target gene normalized with the internal control of b-actin expression from the same tissue was calculated as described in Fig.  7 . Unpaired student t test with Welch correction was used for statistical analysis. (*p, = 0.05, **p, = 0.01). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0069858.g008 paralyzed front and rear limbs with no movement, 4 = 2 rear limbs were moderately paralyzed with difficulty in movement, 3 = paralyzed rear limbs with bending legs, 2 = mildly bending rear limbs, 1 = slightly bending rear limbs, 0 = no paralyzed limbs with normal movement. The tested animals were euthanized by 100% CO2 inhalation for 5 minutes followed by cervical dislocation after completion of the experimental protocol or when weight loss of 20% occurred (according to the guidelines of approved animal-use protocols; protocol no. NHRI-IACUC-101006-A).",
