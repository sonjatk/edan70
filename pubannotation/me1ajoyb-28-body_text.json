    "text": "Finally, it is difficult to assess CTL activity in reservoir hosts. Most colonies are established with wild rodents that are highly polymorphic. This limits use of traditional CTL assays that require MHC class I-matched target cells. The generation of highly inbred strains is challenging and may result in alleles that do not represent the natural biology of hantavirus infection, thus it may not be desirable to generate highly inbred rodents. It is possible to establish MHC homozygotes with controlled breeding and screening of littermates for the same haplotypes. Even then, the generation of susceptible cell lines can be problematic. While endothelial cell lines can be generated with retroviral transformation, it is possible the cells may have activated antiviral pathways that could alter in vitro CTL responses. The use of growth factors for expanding endothelial cells in culture may be more attractive. Until methods are established for generating syngeneic, susceptible target cells, assessment of CTL responses in reservoir hosts will be difficult.",
