    "text": "The exponential growth in the size of biological databases has established the need for high performance computing (HPC) in bioinformatics. Typically, an HPC setup operates in a cluster computing environment consisting of multiple computers that communicate over fast switches. For popular database scanning applications such as BLAST and HMMER the benefits of clusters are immediate and linear speedups can be easily achieved. However, the evolving challenges in life sciences cannot be all addressed by off-the-shelf bioinformatics applications. Life scientists need to analyze their data using novel approaches published in recent journals or based on their own hypotheses and assumptions. Quascade-MP2 has been developed to address this need. It is a visual prototyping tool created especially for data-driven, high performance scientific applications.",
