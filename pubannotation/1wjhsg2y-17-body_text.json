    "text": "Western Asia represents a unique regional mixing pot of bat species from different zoogeographic regions, with a majority of species found in Western Asia also distributed in other regions of the world (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, Southeast Asia). Specifically, the 96 bat species native to Western Asia occupy 8 of the 12 (67%) geographic regions designated by IUCN, with over 90% of all species distributed in more than one region (Table S2) . For example, Pipistrellus tenuis is Emirates; YEM-Yemen. Shapefiles of species' ranges were extracted using the package raster [105] and converted to raster files using package fasterize [106] . Rasterized polygons of species' ranges were cropped to include only Western Asian countries based on ISO 3166 two-letter codes and mapped using packages maptools [107] and viridis [108] . All analyses were conducted in R version 3.4.3 [109] .",
