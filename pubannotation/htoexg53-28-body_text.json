    "text": "Finally, the MVA-MERS-N vector virus generated for this study proved to be a stable recombinant virus that can be readily amplified to obtain vaccine preparations technically fulfilling all requirements for further preclinical or even clinical development. Future work with MVA-MERS-N candidate vaccines should help to elucidate the potential protective capacity of N-specific immune responses in MERS-CoV infections models and contribute to our better understanding of MERS vaccine-induced protection.",
