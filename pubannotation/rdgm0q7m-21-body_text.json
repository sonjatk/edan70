    "text": "From the lack of effect of the KH2 mutation on PRF, we conclude that interaction of this domain with RNA does not occur (or is unnecessary for PRF) and that mutations within the GxxG loop of KH2 do not compromise the specific interaction with nsp1␤. However, the KH1 and KH3 mutations likely modify the interaction of the protein with RNA, and conceivably, with nsp1␤. EMSA analysis confirmed the predicted effects on RNA binding, which was reduced in the case of PCBP2 KH1m , abolished with PCBP2 KH3m and largely unaffected for PCBP2 KH2 (Figure 5E ). Similar results were seen with PCBP1 (Supplementary Figure S5 ). To assess the capacity of the various PCBPs to bind nsp1␤ independently of RNA, a pull-down assay was utilized (Supplementary Figure S6) . Here, immobilized GST-nsp1␤ was incubated with individual His- tagged PCBPs and, after a detergent wash, bound protein was eluted for analysis by immunoblotting. In comparison to WT PCBP2, the binding of PCBP2 bearing any of the three KH domain mutations to GST-tagged nsp1␤ was unaffected, indicating that the effects on PRF are related to changes in RNA binding rather than a reduced capacity to associate with nsp1␤. Indeed, PCBPs 1-4 all bound nsp1␤ in this assay, thus the inability of PCBP4 to trans-activate PRF at the PRRSV signal has some other explanation. Importantly, GST-tagged nsp1␤ RBM was able to pull-down PCBP2, indicating that the defect in this mutant is not in the capacity to associate with its protein partner.",
