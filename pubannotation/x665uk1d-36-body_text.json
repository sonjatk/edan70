    "text": "A 21 base-long ribo-oligonucleotide (500 nM) labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at the 59 terminus and a black hole quencher (BHQ) at the 39 terminus were synthesized (59 FAM-CGATGAGTGCCATGGATATAC-BHQ 39), annealed to the non-labeled complementary ribo-oligonucleotide, and then delivered into cells in 96-black-well plates using Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Immediately after changing the medium, the real-time fluorescence intensity of the cells was read for 2 hr in real time using a fluorescence analyzer at 5 min intervals (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).",
