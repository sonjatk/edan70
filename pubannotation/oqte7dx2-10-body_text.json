    "text": "WDR proteins are involved in protein-protein interactions that mediate diverse cellular processes. WDRs consist of 40-60 amino acids ending in a tryptophan-aspartic acid (WD) motif. The WDR form a funnel-shaped, β-propeller structure made up of 6-8 blades, with each blade consisting of four anti-parallel β-sheets that are held together by extensive hydrogen bonds. This rigid β-propeller structure provides multiple stable surfaces for protein interactions (Pashkova et al., 2010; Stirnimann et al., 2010; Villamil et al., 2013) .",
