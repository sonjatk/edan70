    "text": "Household exposure to pigs: breeding any number of pigs at home. Characteristics of the participants S. suis infection occurred sporadically throughout the year without any clear seasonality (Figure 3 ). Clustering of cases was not observed. Ninety-seven patients (96%) were infected with S. suis serotype 2 while only four patients (4%) were infected with other serotypes, including serotype 14 (3 cases) and untypeable serotype (1 case). S. suis cases were predominantly male (82%) and from a rural residence (81%) with a median (IQR) age of 50 (41-59) years. Twenty-one percent of cases had an occupation related to pigs, other exposure to pigs (46%), or reported eating ''high risk'' dishes in the two weeks prior to admission (48%). Hospital and community controls were more frequently female and (unmatched) hospital controls were significantly younger, with a higher proportion of urban residence (Table 3 ). We further analyzed the age distribution of cases, hospital controls and non-S. suis bacterial meningitis patients amongst the hospital controls. Nearly 70% of S. suis meningitis patients were older than 45 years, while only 25% of non-S. suis meningitis patients and 20% of all hospital controls belonged to this age group ( Table 4 ). The 49 hospital controls with bacterial meningitis (not S. suis) were significantly younger than S. suis cases with median (IQR) age of 27 (23-45) compared to 50 (41-59) years (p,0.001). ",
