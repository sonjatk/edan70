    "text": "Slow-binding inhibition mechanisms can be investigated by pre-incubation of the enzyme with the inhibitor followed by measurement of the initial velocities of substrate hydrolysis as a function of pre-incubation time. In this way, increasing the concentration of diplacone led to a decrease in both the initial velocity (v i ) and the steady-state rate (v s ) (Figs. 1a, 1b and Supplementary Fig. S3a ). The progress curves obtained using various concentrations of the inhibitors were fitted to equation (2) (Supplementary Fig. S3a) to determine v i , v s and k obs . The results for diplacone were fitted to the a slow-binding process (equation 3; Supplementary Fig. S3a) dependence of k obs on the concentration of bacterial sialidase (Fig. 1c) . Based on the above kinetic observations, we conclude that the reaction follows a time-dependent kinetic mechanism (Fig. 1d) . From the results of the fit, values of 0.201 AE 0.003 and 0.0017 AE 0.004 min À1 were obtained for k 5 and k 6 , respectively. Using these values derived from k obs gives a calculated K i app value of 0.065 AE 0.008 mM, which is in agreement with the K i (0.04 mM) value determined using double-reciprocal plots (Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots; Supplementary Fig. S4 ). The hyperbolic dependence observed with the inhibitors suggests that diplacone inhibits sialidase by the rapid formation of an enzyme complex (EÁI) which slowly isomerizes to form a modified enzyme complex (E Ã ÁI) ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3b ).",
