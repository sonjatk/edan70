    "text": "Because most antiviral genes do not serve essential housekeeping functions, they can be lost during periods when selective pressures are relieved, for example during periods when fewer relevant viral pathogens are prevalent in the population. In contrast, selection to increase the breadth of antiviral specificities could also lead to increase in gene copy number [34] . As a result of these repeated rounds of innovations, many organisms undergo dramatic changes in their antiviral gene repertoires over evolutionary timeframes, as has been observed with APOBEC and TRIM genes in mammals [38, 39] . In our initial evolutionary screen, we had observed that most of PARP15 is missing from the whitecheeked gibbon genome. Coupled with previous findings of PARP15 absence in the mouse genome [10] , we therefore investigated PARP genes in general, with an emphasis on the macro-PARP genes, for signatures of rapid gene turnover.",
