    "text": "The diversity between the two age groups can be explained by the different triggers that can induce asthma exacerbations, particularly allergic factors that hardly play a role in the preschool-aged children but are important in the school-aged ones. However, the reasons for the discrepancy between our data and those published in the literature, specifically the spring peak that we clearly highlight, are unclear. Possibly, differences in the climate and in the grass pollen spring outbreak might be part of the explanation.",
