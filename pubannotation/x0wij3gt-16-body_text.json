    "text": "EP4 mediates the cell proliferation and increased expression and activation of PDK1 induced by PGE 2 in HBEc14-KT and BEAS2B cells PGE 2 binds to and activates four distinct receptor subtypes named EP1-4. EP4 has been shown to a target molecule in cancer cell proliferation [19] . To investigate the mechanisms involved in PGE 2 -mediated bronchial epithelial cell proliferation, we transfected cells with EP4 siRNA or pre-treated cells with the EP4 antagonist AH23848 (10 μM). After pre-treatment with EP4 siRNA or antagonist, cell proliferations induced by PGE 2 decreased ( Fig. 2a and b) . EP4 antagonist AH23848 decreased cell proliferation induced by PGE 2 (1.456 ± 0.046 vs 2.078 ± 0.299 in BEAS2B, P <0.01; 1.131 ± 0.052 vs 1.838 ± 0.074 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.01). EP4 siRNA decreased cell proliferation induced by treatment with PGE 2 (1.243 ± 0.018 vs 1.480 ± 0.029 in BEAS2B, P <0.05; 1.086 ± 0.124 vs 1.866 ± 0.015 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.01). This effect was associated with inhibition of phosphorylation and expression of PDK1 ( Fig. 2c and d) (Fig. 2e) . So we conclude that EP4 mediates cell proliferation induced by PGE2 in normal bronchial epithelial cells.",
