    "text": "The mature fruits of Athamanta turbith ssp. hungarica and Athamanta turbith ssp. haynaldii are rich in essential oils, myristicin being the main component of both oils [84] . The capacity for scavenging hydroxyl radicals was evaluated and the authors found that both oils had similar ability. When the activity was evaluated by the DPPH method, the authors reported that Athamanta turbith ssp. hungarica was the most effective, albeit with less ability than the references used (quercetin and ascorbic acid) [84] .",
