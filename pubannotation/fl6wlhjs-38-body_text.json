    "text": "To examine the effect of the filter upon the outbreak signature we examine the standardized quantity for the filters that we defined previously. We set α = 0.03, which corresponds to a false alarm rate of one per month [2] . Then, as shown in the Appendix, the threshold, τ k,α , is chosen by solving P(D k,t > τ k,α ) = α for τ k,α . Either we can estimate this value from the data using the 1 -α quantile of the {D k,t } process of non-outbreak-based training data, or via a normal approximation, given by (10) . There were some differences between the values of τ k,α for the two methods in the simulations we studied. We chose the normal approximation method as it tended to preserve the specificity across the filters and EDs that we considered.",
