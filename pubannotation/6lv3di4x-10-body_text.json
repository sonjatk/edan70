    "text": "CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10 have been described as important chemokines for monocyte recruitment (37) (38) (39) . Consequently, we determined the monocyte chemoattractant . The experiment was repeated three times in duplicate. Data are shown as 25% to 75% interquartile boxes with means and 95% confidence intervals. Different superscript letters indicate significant difference (P Ͻ 0.05) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain (letters without and with apostrophe for JEV Laos and JEV Nakayama, respectively); differences between distinct JEV strains and the mock control at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks (*, P Յ 0.05; **, P Յ 0.002; ***, P Յ 0.001).",
