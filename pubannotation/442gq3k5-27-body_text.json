    "text": "The association between human S. suis infection and occupational exposures to pigs or pork has been reported in Europe and Asia since 1968 [6, 15, 16] . In Vietnam, the proportion of patients reported to have occupational exposures was lower than reported in European patients but it remained an important independent risk factor. Slaughtering and processing sick or dead pigs were also associated with S. suis infection in a case-control study conducted during the Sichuan outbreak [13] .",
