To obtain the true pseudoknot-free http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/147 This table provides the names, description and values of the energy parameters and functions that we used in our methods. The names and definitions are the same as in our original HFold [48] , and the values were updated based on the work of Andronescu et al. [36] . These parameters were derived for a temperature of 37Â°C and 1 M salt concentration.",
