    "text": "Interestingly, rVV-N25 treatment-but not the rVV-CN2 or rVV-CN5 treatment-efficiently induced a HCV-specific activated CD8 T cells response; this difference in efficacy could have one or more possible causes. The HCV structural proteins (core, E1, and E2 proteins) in the rVV-CN construct may cause the difference; Saito et al. reported that injection with plasmid constructs encoding the core protein induced a specific CTL response in BALB/c mice [24] . Reportedly, CTL activity against core or envelope protein is completely absent from transgenic mice immunized with a plasmid encoding the HCV structural proteins, but core-specific CTL activity is present in transgenic mice that were immunized with a plasmid encoding the HCV core [21] . In contrast, when recombinant vaccinia virus expressing different regions of the HCV polyprotein were injected into BALB/c mice, only the HCV core protein markedly suppressed vaccinia-specific CTL responses [25] . Thus, the HCV core protein may have an immunomodulatory function [26] . Based on these reports and our results, we hypothesize that the causes underlying the effectiveness of rVV-N25 treatment were as follows: 1) this rVV construct included the core and envelope proteins and 2) the core protein had an immune-suppressive effect on CTL induction. Therefore, we suggest that exclusion of the core and envelope antigen as immunogen is one important factor in HCV vaccine design.",
