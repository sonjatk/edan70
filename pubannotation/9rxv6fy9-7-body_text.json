    "text": "cells in a particular field of view, while green fluorescence indicated the integration of live influenza A (H1N1) viruses into the cells. Results from the zero-dose control studies (Fig. 1, top left) confirmed that the aerosol irradiation chamber efficiently transmitted the aerosolized viruses through the system, after which the live virus efficiently infected the test mammalian epithelial cells. Figure 2 shows the surviving fraction, as a function of the incident 222-nm far-UVC dose, of exposed H1N1 aerosolized viruses, as measured by the number of focus forming units in incubated epithelial cells relative to unexposed controls. Linear regressions (see below) showed that the survival results were consistent with a classical exponential UV disinfection model with rate constant k = 1.8 cm 2 /mJ (95% confidence intervals 1.5-2.1 cm 2 / mJ). The overall model fit was good, with a coefficient of determination, R 2 = 0.95, which suggests that most of the variability in virus survival was explained by the exponential model. The rate constant of 1.8 cm 2 /mJ corresponds to an inactivation cross-section (dose required to inactivate 95% of the exposed viruses) of D 95 = 1.6 mJ/cm 2 (95% confidence intervals 1.4-1.9 mJ/cm 2 ).",
