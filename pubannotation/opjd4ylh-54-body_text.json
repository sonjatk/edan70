    "text": "TB patients can release tiny particles containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis into the air by coughing, sneezing, laughing, or singing. These particles are called air droplet nuclei. They are invisible to the naked eye. Droplet nuclei can remain airborne in room air for many hours, until they are removed by natural or mechanical ventilation. For TB to spread, there must be a person with TB disease who produces the TB bacilli, and another person who inhales the droplet nuclei containing the bacilli. Although TB is not usually spread by brief contact, anyone who is in close proximity with an infectious person is at risk of getting infected.",
