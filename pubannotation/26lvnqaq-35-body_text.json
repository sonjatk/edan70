    "text": "All of the challenged birds shed viral RNA via the tracheal route on day 4 pi and showed signs of mild depression, ruffled feathers and a transitory arched posture, while we recorded conjunctivitis in approximately onethird of the layers. Birds started showing signs of the disease on day 3 pi and gradually recovered by day 6-7 pi. To compare egg production between groups on a weekly basis, daily values were averaged ( Figure 1 ) and are here expressed as laying rates (%), considering a production of 10 eggs/10 hens/day as a hypothetical value of 100%. Before the infection, all of the layers in the H9 and K groups laid eggs scoring a mean production of 93.0% and 95.0%, respectively and we did not observe any statistical difference between the two groups.",
