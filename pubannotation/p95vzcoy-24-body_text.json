    "text": "Given the prevalence and high titers of DWV and its wide host range [21] , it is not surprising that the field-collected control colonies were also tested positive for DWV at low levels. Since our experimental data clearly show that DWV transmission to ants is feasible via food, we assume that either (1) DWV-contaminated food must have been given to the ant colonies in captivity prior to our experiments or alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, (2) the D. hydei flies used as control food were DWV positive, which we regard as unlikely, or (3) the control colonies had consumed DWV-infected food prior to field-sampling by the company. Given the latter case, this would support the view that DWV transmission to M. rubra also occurs in the field, which would be in line with other studies showing the presence of viruses, originally described from honeybees, in ants [29, 37] . A closer look at the controls also reveals that the viruses are not equally distributed within these naturally infected colonies. It would be interesting to see if the uneven distribution is due to age-related division of labor and non-stochastic interaction patterns [73] , i.e., foragers might have a higher exposure risk compared to in-house workers. Considering the low viral titers in the controls, it is possible that the viruses persist in M. rubra as a covert infection that might turn into an overt infection under suitable conditions, e.g., parasite infections as in honeybees [26] .",
