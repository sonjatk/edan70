    "text": "Infection of epithelial cells with the MERS virus induce slow, but significant, IFN type I and II responses [36] . Macrophages release pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines such as IL-1Î², IL-6 and IL-8 upon MERS-CoV infection [37] . Similarly, MERS-CoV infection in blood monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells leads to the release of chemokines and cytokines, for example, IL-2, IL-3, CCL-2, CCL-3 and RANTES [37, 48] . Infection of activated T cells induces apoptosis via different pathways which may also explain the occurrence of lymphopenia [52] . With the present available knowledge, it is difficult to describe the exact pathogenesis of MERS-CoV, but it seems that viral replication in the macrophages results in extreme cytotoxicity and triggers the induction of pro-inflammatory chemicals which may lead to MERS-associated complications.",
