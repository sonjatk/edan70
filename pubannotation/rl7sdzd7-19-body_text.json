    "text": "Plasmids containing each event were constructed to test the specificity of the MS8 and RF3 assays separately. The junction at the right borders of the transgenes were amplified by PCR from the MS8/RF3 DNA sample using the displacement (outer) primers of the LAMP reactions, MS8-RF3 DisplR (B3c) separately with MS8 DisplF (F3) and RF3 DisplF (F3), to amplify the MS8 and RF3 junctions, respectively (see Figure 1 and Table 1 ). The fragments were cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Southampton, UK) and transformed into DH5Î±. Clones containing the correct inserts were confirmed by sequencing.",
