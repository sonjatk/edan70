    "text": "The final node sampling scheme considered is targeted node sampling (TNS). In TNS, we sample specific nodes based on certain criteria. In this case, we chose the weighted-degree of the node. All nodes having a weighted-degree of at least x are sampled and their neighbours are captured (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). A graphical depiction of the three node sampling network schemes is shown in the electronic supplementary material, figure S2 .",
