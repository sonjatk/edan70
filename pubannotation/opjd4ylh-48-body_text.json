    "text": "TB patients are likely to transmit the disease to the healthcare workers since TB is an airborne disease. This aspect of occupational risk is largely understudied, and preventive measures are frequently not in place. This problem is more in the low-to middle-income countries, due to increased prevalence of TB and lack of effective control programmes. Nurse (N6) said: \"we are exposed to a great risk of being infected by TB, MDR-TB and XDR-TB because we do not have personal protective materials in place and hmmm the hospital also has poor infection control measures.\"",
