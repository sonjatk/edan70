    "text": "In previous work, Tildesley et al. [32] demonstrated that even in the absence of precise locations of farms, accurate predictions of the impact of interventions are possible. We aim to develop an understanding of the predictive power of mathematical models when only a subset of the network information is available. We develop a model to simulate the spread of a rapidly spreading disease such as FMD through the UK cattle movement network. Mathematical models have previously played a key role in determining the risk of disease spread through networks of livestock movements for diseases such as FMD [17, 18, 21, 33] , bTB [12, 13, 19] and bluetongue virus [34, 35] . Our aim in this paper is to investigate the ability of such models to provide policy advice in countries where only partial information regarding livestock movements is available.",
