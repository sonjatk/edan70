    "text": "Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, H. influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis and S. pneumoniae possess capsules that resist phagocytosis [37] . Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of pneumonia [39] , is characterized by over 90 serotypes differentiated by variations in the bacterial polysaccharide capsule [40, 41] and associated with different propensities of invasive potential [42] . In addition to protecting against phagocytosis, the capsule prevents clearance by mucous secretion and restricts autolysis [43] . Other species, including S. aureus, release anti-opsonizing proteins and possess surface protein A to evade phagocytosis. Furthermore, S. aureus secretes leukotoxins that lyse leukocytes and express superantigens that hinder immune response (reviewed by Naber et al. [44] ).",
