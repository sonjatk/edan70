    "text": "• level: If structure G can be decomposed into k disjoint pseudoknot-free structures, G 1 , G 2 , . . . , G k , such that every base pair in G i crosses the base pairs of G j , 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ k, Sato et al. say that structure G has k levels. For example, a pseudoknot-free structure has level 1, and an H-type pseudoknot has level 2. In another example, when representing the secondary structure in dot bracket format, the number of different brackets used to represent the structure is the level of the structure. IPknot can handle structures up to level 3. • scoring model: The energy model used to produce posterior probabilities for each base pair is called \"scoring model\". IPknot has 3 different scoring models, namely \"CONTRAfold\", \"McCaskill\" and \"NUPACK\". • refining parameters: The procedure of recalculating the base pair probabilities based on the original prediction results is referred to as \"refining parameters\". • base pair weights for each level: Positive numbers representing the rate of true base pairs in each level.",
