    "text": "Domestic dogs are considered the only known primary reservoir for L. infantum infection [38] . It has been considered for a long time that cats did not play any role in the epidemiology of L. infantum in endemic areas. This view was directed by the facts that, for a long period, very few cases of clinical leishmaniosis were described in cats as compared to dogs, and that Italy (Imperia, Liguria) PCR-RFLP [26] Italy (Messina, Sicily) MLEE [10] Italy (Lipari island, Sicily) MLEE and PCR-RFLP [11] Switzerland a PCR and sequencing [50] France (Alpes-Maritimes) MLEE [12] Spain (Barcelona) PCR and sequencing [29] Spain (Madrid community) PCR and sequencing [33, 78] Spain a ILMA [68] Spain (Mallorca) b PCR-RFLP [95] Portugal (Lisbon region) PCR and sequencing [96, 97] Portugal (Lisbon and Algarve regions) PCR and sequencing [98] Greece (Thessaly and Macedonia) PCR and sequencing [99] Brazil (Cotia, SÃ£o Paulo state) PCR and sequencing [100] Brazil (Rio de Janeiro) PCR and hybridization [101] Brazil [23] cats have also been considered more resistant to experimental infection [39] . This interpretation has changed, as the concepts of reservoir and susceptibility in infected hosts are now better understood. The majority of infected dogs does not exhibit clinical signs (at least for a long period), although they can be infectious to sand flies and consequently serve as sources of infection. During the last two decades, many wild mammals have been diagnosed with Leishmania infection by serological and/or molecular methods [40] . However, their role as reliable sources of infection (infectiousness to sand flies, persistent infection) remains unknown [40] . The recent demonstration that hares can be persistently infected, infectious to sandflies and a reservoir for humans in the absence of participation of dogs in the transmission cycle opens a possible evaluation of the role of species other than dogs in the epidemiology of L. infantum infections in particular scenarios [41, 42] .",
