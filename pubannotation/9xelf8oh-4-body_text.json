    "text": "Despite the putative advantages of qPCR assays, only 35 % (48/136) of reviewed studies of wildlife disease surveillance published since 2011 have used qPCR; furthermore, only 8 % (7/88) and 11 % (5/45) of conventional PCR and qPCR studies, respectively, used an IC. Use of a multiplex reaction was similarly limited, accounting for only 14 % (12/88) and 10 % (4/39), respectively, of wildlife disease surveillance studies. The implication is that contemporary techniques in molecular epidemiology are underutilised in wildlife disease surveillance (see also Benton et al. 2015) .",
