However, the reader may not be familiar with these methodologies and, most importantly, this significant part of the paper should stand alone. To enable a more friendly reading, the authors are kindly required to provide the data used in the methodology, step by step, as supplementary data (i.e. BoD, national estimates/statistics, PAF etc).This would improve a lot the quality and value of this publication.
