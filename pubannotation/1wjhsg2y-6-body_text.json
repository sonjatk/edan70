    "text": "Bats provide vital ecological and economic services, most notably pollination of fruit crops, forest regeneration through seed dispersal, suppression of insect pests that damage crops and vector human diseases, and primary suppliers of nutrients (guano) in cave ecosystems [55] . Yet human pressures on bat populations are manifold, with rapid land conversion from urban encroachment and agricultural intensification contributing to rapid declines in bat populations globally [3] . Human pressures are magnified further by overexploitation through unregulated hunting for consumption, inclusion in medicinal remedies (e.g., asthma) [56] , sport [57] , and the souvenir trade [58] . In addition to these relatively widespread threats to bats, regional threats also exist that can lead to indirect killing of bats, or persecution and disturbance of roosting bats. In Western Asia, widespread application of pesticides to control crop pests, including spraying in caves and abandoned buildings occupied by bats [59, 60] , and agricultural intensification, which has led to the establishment of irrigation systems that deplete available water in this largely arid region [60] , have contributed to declines in regional bat populations. A more recent and unique threat to bats in Western Asia is the fraudulent scheme of selling \"bat nests\" on Facebook and other social media platforms, with sellers claiming the \"nests\" contain \"red mercury\" that has healing properties [61] . There are no documented cases of bats building nests [62] , yet the perceived notion that bats create such economically valuable structures has likely led to increased cave disturbance, potentially displacing or indirectly killing roosting bats [61] . This fraud is speculated to have originated in Iran but has quickly grown in popularity in Jordan [63] and Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Iraq [61] .",
