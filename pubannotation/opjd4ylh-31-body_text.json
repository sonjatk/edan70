    "text": "The findings of this study revealed that there was a more negative practice environment in the TB wards than a positive one. According to the study that was done by Washeya [15] , it is important that the working environment enhances productivity. The findings of this study indicated that there was a poor practice environment in the TB wards. There was also an inadequate supply of personal protective materials. This leads to negative practice by the nurses, since they are afraid to contract diseases. The findings of the present study concur with those of a study that was done by Mametja [16] , which indicated that there was a more negative practice environment in HIV/AIDS wards which affected the quality of nursing care in the public hospital.",
