    "text": "To increase silencing efficiency in these cells, lentiviruses coding control or IFITM-specific miR30-shRNAs were provided along with virion-like particles containing the Vpx protein of SIV MAC (VLPs-Vpx), tool that allows an efficient step of reverse transcription and infection of lentiviruses in myeloid cells [38, 39] . Two days afterwards, cells were challenged as above with R5-tropic replication- Figure 4 IFITMs are interferon-regulated proteins that display heterogeneous cell type dependent expression and appear incorporated in HIV-1 virions proportionally to their intracellular levels. A) The ectopic expression levels of IFITMs in HEK293T cells used before were compared to the endogenous expression of IFITMs in different cells, incubated or not with IFNα (at 1000 U/mL for 24 hours). Given that the antibodies in our hands did not distinguish between IFITM members anti-IFITM1, −2 and −3 antibodies were used together, so that all three forms are recognized. B) HEK293T and HeLaP4 cells were transfected with DNAs coding HIV-1-gfp and twenty-four hours later cells were stimulated with 1000U/mL of IFNα for further two days. Virions were then purified and analyzed by WB and upon exo-RT normalization they were used to challenge HeLa P4 cells. C) Primary macrophages obtained upon differentiation of monocytes in M-CSF for 4 days were challenged with an MOI of 0,1 of the R5-tropic HIV-1 strain ADA. Aliquots of the supernatant were harvested every few days and the extent of viral spread through the culture was measured by exo-RT activity. Cells and virion particles were harvested at the indicated time points after infection. Virion particles obtained from day 6 and 9 were normalized by exo-RT activity, while the amount of virus obtained at day 3 was too low to be quantified further. Exo-RT normalized virions obtained at day 6 and 9 were used to challenge HeLaP5 cells for a MAGI assay. The graph presents a typical replication curve obtained upon infection of ADA in primary MDM and the dotted line represents the limit of detection of the assay. All WB panels present representative results obtained out of 3 to 5 independent experiments and donors, while the graphs present averages and SEM of 3 independent experiments. competent ADA at an MOI of 1 prior to extensive cell washing and trypsin treatment. Viral particles produced by knockdown cells were then harvested 4 to 6 days after and upon exo-RT normalization, viruses were used on HeLaP5 cells (expressing the CCR5 co-receptor) for a MAGI assay ( Figure 5B ). Under these conditions, viruses produced in MDM silenced for IFITMs displayed a remarkable increase in their infectivity over a single round infection assay, confirming the positive effect that the removal of IFITMs plays on the infectivity of viral particles. Of note, the basal expression of IFITMs was higher in miR30-shRNA transduced MDM, irrespectively of the target sequence, when compared to untreated cells (for example, compare the basal levels of expression observed here with the one of Figure 4A ). We believe this is due to the detection of the HIV vectors used for silencing, or to the detection of its end products, ie double stranded RNAs, as described in [40] [41] [42] . However, since equal conditions were used for control and specific knockdowns, we believe this not to be a confounding factor in the analysis of the results.",
