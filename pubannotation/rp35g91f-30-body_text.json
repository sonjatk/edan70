    "text": "Of the 21 genes in our gene network, NKX2-5 binding sites were detected within 10 kb of seven genes (Rbm20, Corin, Myl7, Tnnt2, Ryr2, Fgf12, and Myh7) in the He et al. data set, two genes (Mybpc3 and Trdn) in the Dupays et al. data set, and three genes (Tbx20, Mybphl, and Atp2a2) in both data sets (Dupays et al. 2015; He et al. 2011) (Table  4) . Collectively, this indicates that at least 50% of the genes in the pulmonary myocardium gene network are bound by NKX2-5 in heart tissue at some point during development. We also examined NKX2-5 enrichment at our candidate pulmonary myocardium control loci on Chr1 and Chr2 and found NKX2-5 enrichment at Rab23, Zfp451, and Nostrin in the He et al. data set. Although tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms may differ between the heart and the pulmonary myocardium, this is strong evidence to support the theory that NKX2-5 could directly regulate expression of the pulmonary myocardium gene network.",
