    "text": "The exact role of microglia during viral infection has been difficult to define because infiltrating monocytes can mask the impact of resident microglia. In a previous report, IL34 −/− mice, which have significantly reduced development of microglia, are more susceptible to lethal infection after WNV-NS5-E218A i.c. inoculation [36] . Similar to results reported here, IL34 −/− mice exhibited increased neuronal death compared with wildtype controls. In contrast with PLX5622-treated mice, IL34 −/− mice exhibited similar levels of viral burden compared with wildtype controls in the brain at 3 and 6 dpi. Numbers of infiltrating monocytes/macrophages and WNV-specific T cells were also similar between IL34 −/− and wildtype controls; however, the authors did not investigate antiviral T cell activation in this model [36] . In another model of flavivirus encephalitis, in which suckling mice were infected with dengue virus, depletion of microglia with liposome-encapsulated clodronate resulted in increased viral replication and reduced infiltration of IFNγ + CD8 + T cells [70] . Here, we report no reduction in CD8 + T cell infiltration; however, this difference may be due to the age of mice, virus, and/or method of microglial depletion. Another recent study reported use of PLX5622 in a model of neuroattenuated murine corona virus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Similar to our results, PLX5622 treatment resulted in increased viral replication and lethality. In contrast to our results, PLX5622 treatment reduced expression of MHCII on microglia and macrophages and reduced CD4 + T cell response [60] . While CD4 + T cells can improve CD8 + T cell response, the dependence of CD8 + T cells on CD4 + T cells varies by virus, antigen exposure, tissue environment, and effector sites [71] . In models of MHV encephalitis, control of viral replication requires a collaborative effort between CD4 + and CD8 + T cells [71] . However, when virus replication induces activation of APCs, activation of CD8 + T cells is relatively CD4 + T cell-independent [71] .",
