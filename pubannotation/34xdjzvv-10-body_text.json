    "text": "Upregulation of CXCL10 and CCL3 in the CNS and peripheral tissues after virulent 5746 infection in transgenic mice was reported by our previous works. This is also corresponds to the clinical findings where CXCL10 increased in patients with EV71 [19] . Higher expression of CCL3 observed in the CNS of transgenic mice infected with EV71 may contribute to the recruitment of granulocytes (neutrophils) during inflammation in the brain. Cytokine storm is thus proposed to cause severe symptoms. Administration of Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) which suppresses cytokine production has been used to treat severe cases [13] [14] [15] 20] . We measured the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in the tissues of 5746-infected mice while receiving N3. Quantitative RT-PCR to the specific cytokines showed that CXCL10 expression was significantly reduced in brainstem, spinal cord, and limb muscle after N3 treatment (Fig. 7A ). CCL3 expression was reduced in the brain and limb muscle (Fig. 7B ).",
