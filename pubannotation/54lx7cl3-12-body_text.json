    "text": "Various other factors-including underlying medical conditions and smoking-can increase the risk of pneumonia by compromising pulmonary clearance mechanisms and the host immune response [47] , potentially influencing the selection of pathogens in both the URT and LRT . Age plays a major role in pneumonia risk. In developed countries, such as the USA, the risk of pneumonia is highest in individuals who are 65 years or over (Fig. 1 ) [48] . The elevated risk in the elderly is likely due to impaired host defenses and an increase in comorbidities-heart failure, liver disease and underlying lung diseasewhich increase risk of aspiration pneumonia that can occur from dysphagia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (reviewed by Akg√ºn et al. [49] ). In developing countries, the burden of pneumonia is greatest in young children [2] due to their inability to physically remove and immunologically deal with bacterial pathogens (reviewed by Siegrist [50] ). Very young children also have the greatest prevalence in the nasopharynx of common bacterial pneumonia pathogens: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis [23, 51] . Increased carriage may be an important risk factor for pneumonia if the URT bacterial community structure is a determinant of pneumonia etiology. Unfortunately, the majority of carriage studies have been conducted among children <5 years of age, which limits our ability to establish the role of nasopharyngeal carriage in other age groups.",
