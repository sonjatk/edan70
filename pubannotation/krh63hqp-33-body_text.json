    "text": "Human influenza has such a high mutation rate that, even within a single host individual, the virus quickly becomes a genetically diverse \"swarm\" [61, 62] . Yet, globally human H1N1 influenza is monophyletic and all current variation is of recent origin. This is only possible if almost all human influenza lineages rapidly go extinct. Moreover, we present strong evidence that the H1N1 genome has been systematically degenerating since 1918. This is evidenced by continuous, systematic, and rapid changes in the H1N1 genome throughout its history. For example, there was an especially rapid and monotonic accumulation of mutations during a single pandemic (Figure 1 ). Similarly, there was a continuous and rapid accumulation of mutations over the entire history of the virus (Figures 2 and 3) , including a similar steady increase in nonsynonymous amino acid substitutions (Figure 3 ). While mutations accumulated in the human H1N1s, there was a parallel accumulation of mutations in the porcine H1N1 lineage (Figure 4) . Fitch, et al. [36] also showed a linear mutation accumulation curve. The \"gnarled trunk\" of Ito, et al. [42] should be buried in our data as well, but it will be swamped by the pervasive, genome-wide accumulation of mutations not under active selection.",
