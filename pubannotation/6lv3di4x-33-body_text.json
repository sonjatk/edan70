    "text": "Confocal microscopy imaging. Porcine nasal mucosa tissue slices 4 m thick were washed in confocal buffer (CB; 50 nM ammonium chloride and 0.1% saponin in PBS Ϫ/Ϫ ) for 30 min and then incubated with anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2 for 2 h. After 3 washes with CB, the tissue was incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-IgG2a (Thermo Fisher), and Cy3-conjugated anti-␤tubulin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was used for the detection of cilia. Porcine NEC cultured on the Transwell membranes were washed with PBS Ϫ/Ϫ and incubated in 4% PFA for 15 min. In the second step, the membranes were incubated in CB for 30 min. Cells were incubated with anti-ZO-1 (Thermo Fisher) and anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2 for 2 h, followed by Alexa Fluor 633-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Thermo Fisher), Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-IgG2a (Thermo Fisher), and Cy3-conjugated anti-␤-tubulin (Abcam). For evaluation of cell death in porcine NEC, Abcam's Fixable Cell Viability Assay Kit (Fluorometric-Blue)-CytoPainter was applied for 30 min, and then cells were washed with PBS Ϫ/Ϫ and fixed with 4% PFA, followed by an incubation with anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2 as described before and labeling with phalloidin conjugated with AF555 (Thermo Fisher) and Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-IgG2a (Thermo Fisher) for 1 h. As a positive control for cleaved caspase 3 (C-Cas3) staining, apoptosis in porcine NEC was induced by incubation with anti-human CD90 (5E10; Becton, Dickinson). For detection of apoptotic cells, inserts were fixed with 4% PFA and incubated in CB for 30 min, incubated with anti-C-Cas3 (Cell Signaling Technologies), anti-flavivirus E protein antibody 4G2 for 2 h, washed, and labeled with phalloidin conjugated with AF647, Alexa Fluor 633-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Alexa Fluor 488-coupled anti-IgG2a (Thermo Fisher) for 1 h. All incubations were performed at room temperature in the dark. For each staining, 4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Sigma) at 2 g/ml was applied for 5 min at 37°C and washed off with PBS Ϫ/Ϫ . Then tissue slices of porcine NEC were mounted on glass slides in Mowiol 4-88 reagent (Sigma). For confocal microscopy analysis, a confocal microscope A1 (Nikon AG) combined with an ECLIPSE Ti inverted microscope (Nikon) and digital imaging Nikon software (AR 3.30.02) were used. The image acquisitions were performed with the 40ϫ objective, sequential channel acquisition and not simultaneous was employed; in order to give high-resolution images, the acquiring setting was performed with optimized voxel size and automatic threshold. The images were analyzed with Imaris 8.0.2 software (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland). To avoid false-positive emissions, different settings were applied, including background subtraction, threshold applications, gamma correction, and maxima. Insert surface staining (for E protein, CytoPainter, and C-Cas3) was calculated as average of positive signal of each channel from 20 different nonoverlapping fields in triplicate porcine NECs using confocal microscopy.",
