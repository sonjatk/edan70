    "text": "Since sialidase inhibitors are substrate analogues and typically exhibit competitive kinetics, it is interesting to explore natural non-substrate mimics such as flavonoids, (oligo)stilbenes, coumarins and diarylheptanoids (Grienke et al., 2012) . Flavonoids, which are polyphenolic compounds, are widespread in the plant kingdom and are known to show antibacterial and antiviral effects (Liu et al., 2008; Jeong et al., 2009; Grienke et al., 2012) . Natural flavonoids have also been reported to have latent anti-influenza and antibacterial effects against SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus, MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and Chagas disease mediated by a trypanosome (Arioka et al., 2010; Cho et al., 2013; Navrá tilová et al., 2013) .",
