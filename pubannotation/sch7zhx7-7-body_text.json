    "text": "Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO; TargetMol, Boston, MA, USA) and N1,N11-Diethylnorspermine (DENSpm; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) were diluted to 100× solution (100 mM and 10 mM, respectively) in sterile water. For DFMO treatments, cells were trypsinized and reseeded with fresh medium supplemented with 2% serum. Following overnight attachment, cells were treated with 100 µM, 500 µM, 1 mM, or 2 mM DFMO. Cells were incubated with DFMO for 96 h to allow for depletion of polyamines in Vero cells. For DENSpm treatment, cells were treated with 100 nM, 1 µM, 10 µM, 100 µM, and 1 mM 16 h prior to infection. During infection, media was cleared and saved from the cells. The same medium containing DFMO and DENSpm was then used to replenish the cells following infection. Cells were incubated at the appropriate temperature for the duration of the infection.",
