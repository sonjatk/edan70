    "text": "Xanthine oxidase is a dehydrogenase enzyme that transfers electrons to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ), reducing it to NADH, and oxidizes xanthine or hypoxanthine to uric acid. Nevertheless, under stress conditions, the dehydrogenase is converted to an oxidase enzyme and, under these conditions, the enzyme reduces oxygen instead of NAD + . On this way, there is a reduction of dioxygen to superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. Superoxide anion can be generated by this system (the hypoxanthine -xanthine oxidase) or using a non-enzymatic reaction. In this case, superoxide anion is generated through the reaction of phenazine methosulphate in the presence of NADH and dioxygen. In both cases, superoxide anion reduces nitro-blue tetrazolium (NBT) into formazan which is followed spectrophotometrically [5] .",
