    "text": "With resistance mutations emerging in CVB3 2A and 3C proteases, we next hypothesized that these mutations may enhance viral replication in polyamine-depleted cells by maintaining proteolytic activity. To test this, we generated mutant 2A 29K and 3C 52R proteases through site-directed mutagenesis of our overexpression vectors. We then cotransfected these proteases and the wildtype controls with our luciferase reporter system into untreated and 500 ÂµM DFMO-treated Veros. At 24 h, we measured luciferase activity and normalized to renilla luciferase activity and to control cells transfected with luciferase reporter alone (no protease). We observed that both 2A WT and 3C WT exhibited protease activity that was DFMO-sensitive ( Figure 5A,B) . Interestingly, we also observed that both 2A 29K and 3C 52R exhibited robust protease activity, even in DFMO-treated cells. We also observed that 3C 52R exhibited higher protease activity than 3C WT , though this was not observed for 2A.",
