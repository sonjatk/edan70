    "text": "Until now, the role of the vast variety of DUBs in the replication cycle of viruses is poorly understood, although there is an increasing evidence that besides HIV also other virus families evolved strategies to hijack the UPS in order to accomplish their own replication successfully. For instance, it could be shown that Ub-ligases as well as the 26S proteasome play an important role in various steps of virus replication, e.g., entry, maturation and latent virus reactivation [75] [76] [77] [78] . Regarding the role of DUBs in HIV-1 replication, it has been shown that the ESCRT-III interacting DUB AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM) can inhibit viral particle production, while AMSH knockdown did not influence virus release [79] . Interestingly, AMSH has been reported to bind to the ESCRT-III component CHMP3 upon coexpression, which then acts as inhibitor of HIV-1 release [80] . Recently, selective DIs have become available and facilitate the investigation of the role of DUBs in viral replication. Some of these DIs allow selective targeting of just one of the 90 known DUBs which might be one explanation for their relatively low toxicity [81] [82] [83] [84] . However, an antiretroviral activity of DIs has been reported herein for the first time.",
