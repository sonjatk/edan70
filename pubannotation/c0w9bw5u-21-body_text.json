    "text": "Coronaviruses encode multiple proteins to counteract the host innate antiviral response. 58-60 MERS-CoV is no exception. Several MERS-CoV-encoded proteins have been identified to be IFN antagonists. We, and others, have characterized at least three IFN-antagonizing proteins encoded by MERS-CoV. In addition to the M protein reported in this study, ORF4a is a dsRNA-binding protein, which directly inhibits RLR activation induced by dsRNA and/or the protein co-activator PACT. 24, 25 In addition, our unpublished data also revealed that ORF4b is a potent IFN antagonist. This is in line with findings by other groups although the mechanistic details of its action have not well documented. 22, 23 One recent report suggested that ORF4b might not only interact directly with TBK1/ IKKÎµ in the cytoplasm but also perturb IFN production in the nucleus through an as yet unknown mechanism. 61 Nevertheless, how M, ORF4a, ORF4b and the other IFN-antagonizing proteins of MERS-CoV coordinate with each other to modulate the host innate antiviral response to facilitate viral replication and propagation remains elusive.",
