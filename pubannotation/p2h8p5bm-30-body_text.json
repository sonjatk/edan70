    "text": "Viperin is highly conserved in evolution and was first identified as an IFN-inducible protein with antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus in 2001 [157] . Over the last 17 years, viperin has gained lot of attention and was shown to exhibit broad antiviral activity [158] . Viperin is also known as one of the most highly upregulated genes after viral infection [146, 159] . Within the family of flaviviridae, viperin has been shown to inhibit several members, such as WNV [160] , DENV [161] , ZIKV [162] , hepatitis C virus [163] , and TBEV [86, 141, 149, 150] . Viperin is an iron sulphur protein with three domains; a N-terminus amphipathic alpha-helix which mediates the intracellular localization to the ER, a S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) radical domain [158, 164, 165] homologous to a family of proteins that use SAM as a cofactor [166] , and a highly conserved C-terminal domain, important for iron sulphur (Fe/S) maturation [149, 167] . Although viperin is able to inhibit several different viruses, the mechanism of action, the important motif in viperin and the step of viral life cycle inhibited differs for different viruses [158] . Viperin interacts with many viral and host factors for its antiviral function. TBEV replication is strongly inhibited by viperin, our research shows that viperin has no effect on the binding or entry of TBEV. However, viperin targets genome replication, packaging, and release of TBEV (Figure 3 ) [86, 149, 150] . Viperin specifically targets the plus-sense RNA synthesis with no significant effect on the negative-sense RNA of TBEV during genomic replication [149] . Viperin's Fe/S maturation is dependent on Ciao1 [149, 167] . The Fe/S cluster and a functional SAM domain of viperin is essential to inhibit the synthesis of the plus-sense RNA of TBEV [149] . However, the target for the radical SAM activity important for the antiviral activity of TBEV is currently unknown. The structure of viperin was recently characterized [168] , and based on similarities to other radical SAM enzymes, several different hypothesis have been put forward regarding the substrate of viperin and its antiviral activity [168] [169] [170] . However, none of these have shown importance in the context of mammalian viral infection. Although the exact mode of action against TBEV is not well understood, recent data indicates that viperin interacts with several viral proteins; both structural prM and E and non-structural NS2A, NS2B, and NS3. These interactions lead to a viperin-NS3 dependent degradation of viral proteins. The degradation of TBEV NS3 was shown to be proteasome dependent [150] (Figure 3) . Interestingly, IFN treatment induces an increase of TBEV capsid particles and this effect was found to be dependent on viperin. Viperin mediated this effect by interacting, via its N-terminus, with the cellular protein Golgi Brefeldin A resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 (GBF1) [86] . GBF1 is a key protein in the cellular secretory pathway and essential in the life cycle of many RNA viruses, which utilize vesicular trafficking in their replication cycle and assembly process [171] [172] [173] [174] (Figure 3 ). Viperin targets the NS3 protein for proteasomal degradation which inhibits the synthesis of + strand RNA. Furthermore, NS3 interacts with E, NS2A, and NS2B and these proteins are degraded by viperin in a NS3-dependent manner. Viperin also interferes with particle assembly by inducing secretion of C particles in a COPII-dependent manner, independent of COPI. Viperin mediates this effect by interacting and sequestering GBF1. Red arrow = secretory pathway, blue arrow = \"?\" vesicular transport via unknown pathway.",
