    "text": "Accession numbers for all available complete flu genomes were obtained from the Influenza Research Database [45] as of June 1, 2012. This list was then compared to those available at FluGenome.org [46] . To create a list of the 2009-2010 H1N1 outbreak versions, we used the collated genome list from Kedwaii, et al. [8] . Using these two accession lists, sequence data were obtained from GenBank [47]. We removed non-human/swine, non-H1N1, and incomplete genomes from this list, obtaining 3,755 human and 351 swine genomes. Because there are few indels in these flu genomes, a simple first-pass alignment algorithm, written in Perl with the BioPerl toolkit [48] , was used. Essentially, we visually picked out a 6-10-nucleotide candidate region close to the beginning of each of the eight strands of the flu genome that appeared mostly conserved. The algorithm scanned each set of sequences for this segment and added an appropriate number of spaces to the beginning of each for a rough alignment. Using BioEdit [49] , we simply looked for sequences that were misaligned and inserted gaps where necessary to complete the alignment, paying close attention to codon usage. In difficult and ambiguous regions, we chose to minimize the number of changes necessary to produce each variant, similar to the methodology of Carter [44] .",
