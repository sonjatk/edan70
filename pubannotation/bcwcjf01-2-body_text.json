    "text": "Rabies virus (RABV) is one of the most deadly pathogens known and is able to infect a wide variety of mammalian hosts. RABV is present on all continents except for Antarctica and has reservoirs in terrestrial species as well as bats (Chiroptera). Although vaccination and antibody therapy is effective in treating known exposures to RABV, an estimated 55,000 human deaths occur annually mostly in developing countries [1] . RABV is a member of the Lyssavirus genus, family Rhabdoviridae. The genome is composed of negative-sense single-stranded RNA, about 12 kb in size which codes for five proteins-nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G) and polymerase (L). Like other RNA viruses, RABV has a high mutation rate due to the high error rate of the polymerase, thus populations of RABV exist as a mutant swarm, or quasispecies [2] . RABV evolution is believed to be driven predominantly by purifying selection and RABV is not known to recombine [3] [4] [5] [6] .",
