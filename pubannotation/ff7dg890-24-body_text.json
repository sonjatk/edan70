    "text": "Despite visually similar solutions, the SIR best-fit and SEIR best-fit models ( Figure 3C ) result in strikingly different estimates of R 0 : 3.74 for the SIR model versus 35.9 for the SEIR model, which is partly a result of the small population size. However, the best-fit estimate of R 0 obtained from the gamma-distributed SEIR model (m ¼ 2, n ¼ 2) is much more sensitive to the number of points used to obtain the fit ( Figure 3D ): the exponentially distributed SIR model gives the same estimate whether the first six (up to the peak in incidence) or more points are used. This difference is further emphasized if we use the first few points of the data to estimate the rate of epidemic take-off (k ¼ 1.0837 d À1 ), and then take the final estimates of the average latent and infectious periods to compute R 0 using equation 4. For the SIR model (n ¼ 1, 1/c ¼ 2.2 d) we obtain an R 0 of 4.38 whereas for the SEIR model (m ¼ 2, n ¼ 2, 1/r ¼ 2.6 d, 1/c ¼ 2.1 d) we obtain an R 0 of 16.9. Thus the initial rate of increase in incidence does well in estimating R 0 for the exponentially distributed SIR model but significantly less well for the gamma-distributed SEIR model. Given that we are fitting an additional parameter, it is to be expected that a limited number of data points confounds the estimation of R 0 when we include a latent period in the model assumptions. However, this also highlights that even when incorporating a latent period, estimates of R 0 based on the initial epidemic growth rate may potentially underestimate the true value of R 0 .",
