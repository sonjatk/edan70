    "text": "Similar studies have been performed using bank vole cells infected with PUUV [78] . Embryonic fibroblasts inoculated with PUUV did not express increased amounts of IfnÎ² or Mx2, although non-related viruses were able to induce up-regulation of these genes. This suggests, as with SEOV, PUUV efficiently antagonizes host innate responses in its natural reservoir.",
