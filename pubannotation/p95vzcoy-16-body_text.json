    "text": "All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.5.1 [64] and R Studio version 1.1.456 [65] . Data were checked for normality with the Shapiro-Wilk test and homogeneity of variances with the Levene's test and subsequent statistical tests chosen accordingly. We used the lmer function from the package lme4 [66] to perform a linear mixed effect analysis to test for differences of viral titers over time between the treatments. The logarithm of the viral titers entered the model as a response variable. As fixed effects, we used sampling week and treatment including their interaction term. As a random effect, we added the colony identity to control for multiple testing of the same colonies (week [13] [14] [15] [16] . Visual inspection of residual plots did not reveal deviations from homoscedasticity or normality. p-values were obtained by comparing the model with the effect in question against the model without it, using an ANOVA as a likelihood ratio test. The post-hoc pairwise comparison was then performed using the Bonferroni correction.",
