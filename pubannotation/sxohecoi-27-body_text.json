    "text": "Some studies have reported that anti-HIV-1 Env IgG antibodies can inhibit transcytosis [9, 60, 61] . One of these studies found that polyclonal anti-HIV Env IgG inhibited transcytosis of cell-free virus on HEC-1 cells, whereas none of 13 mAbs did; in fact, some of the mAbs might have increased transcytosis, although by no more than about 50% [61] . To our knowledge, none of these studies was carried out under the acidic conditions that characterize female genital tract secretions.",
