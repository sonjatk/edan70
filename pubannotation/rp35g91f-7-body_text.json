    "text": "Analysis of public data sets The GeneNetwork suite of online programs, incorporating WebQTL (Chesler et al. 2004; Wang et al. 2003) , was used to analyze the publicly available BXD lung transcriptome data set (GN160) (www.genenetwork. org/webqtl/main.py) generated by Alberts et al. (2011) . Genome-wide association analyses were performed using gene expression microarray values measured on a log 2 scale. Correlation analysis was performed with Pearson's correlation, and outliers were removed. For interval mapping, likelihood ratio statistic (LRS) scores were plotted on the y-axis vs. chromosomal location on the x-axis (autosomes and X chromosome). An LRS score .17 was significant and an LRS score .10 was suggestive at a genome-wide P value of ,0.05 using 5000 permutations. LRS scores were computed using Haley-Knott regression (Haley and Knott 1992) . The genomic intervals analyzed were selected based on the location at which the eQTL peak crossed the suggested or significant LRS threshold. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to merge multiple gene expression traits into a single, synthetic trait that represented a cellspecific gene expression signature.",
