Serum samples from healthy individuals and patients with CHB and HBV-induced ACLF were obtained from the Department of Infectious Diseases and the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (Guangzhou, China) (Tables I and II) . HBV-induced ACLF was diagnosed using the previously described criteria (10, 11 Sample preparation and protein extraction. Plasma was fractionated with ProteinMiner Protein Enrichment Small-Capacity kit, Cat# 163-3006, (ProteinMiner ; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein solutions were reduced for 1 h at 56ËšC with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and were cysteine-blocked with 55 mM iodoacetamide (IAA) at room temperature for 10 min. Each sample was precipitated with four-times the volume of cold acetone. The total protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay.",
