    "text": "Here {V k,t } are the visit counts for city k and {T k,t } is the smoothed time series of temperatures for city k, filtered by taking a thirty day moving average to remove intra-month variation. To complete the model we assume that {X k,t } is a zero mean stationary time series (we discuss the consequences of this assumption in the Discussion), that we shall represent using a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average process (SARIMA). The SARIMA model (defined in the Appendix) allows for simultaneous modeling of dependencies on both the day as well as the weekly seasonal scales. To aid in the comparison of the dependencies across cities, the order of the time series model, as determined by choosing the autoregressive (p k and P k ) and moving average orders (q k and Q k ), will be the same for each city k.",
