    "text": "The proteasomal pathway is important during WNV infection. A. Hsu cells were pre-treated with MG132 at various concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 μM) for 1 h prior to WNV infection. Total RNA and supernatant medium were collected at 48 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using WNV NS1 primers. RpL32 primers were used as an internal control. Error bars represent standard errors from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05, comparing between control and MG132 treated cells). B. Viral titer estimation by plaque assays conducted on the supernatant media from cells treated as in A. Error bars represents standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05 compared to control). C. Hsu cells were pre-treated with MG132 at various concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 μM) for 1 h prior to infection with WNV at 4°C. Cells were moved to 30°C and total RNA was collected at 6 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using WNV NS1 primers. RpL32 primers were used as an internal control. Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05, comparing between control and MG132 treated cells). D. Hsu cells were infected with WNV, followed by treatment with 10 μM MG132 at 2, 4 or 6 hpi. Total RNA was collected at 48 hpi and real-time RT-qPCR was performed using WNV NS1 primers. RpL32 primers were used as an internal control. Error bars represents standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05, comparing between control and MG132-treated cells). performed on the supernatant media showed a similar dose-dependent decrease in viral titers, with a 20-fold reduction in cells treated with 10 μM MG132 (30 pfu/ml) compared to untreated controls (600 pfu/ml) (Fig 2B) . These results suggest the proteasomal pathway is required for efficient WNV replication in Culex cells.",
