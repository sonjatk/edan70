    "text": "In order to check whether the phosphorylation of IκBα was altered in ORF2 expressing cells, the level of phosphorylated IκBα (ser32) was measured in ORF2 expressing cells. ORF2 expression marginally increased the levels of phospho IκBα ( Figure 2C , upper panel, lane 1 and 2; see the densitometric estimation of band intensities in the graph below) as well as the level of total IκBα (middle panel, lane 1 and 2). In IKKβ and ORF2 co-expressing cells, the level of total as well as phosphorylated IκBα was significantly higher as compared to only IKKβ expressing cells ( Figure 2C , lane 3 and 4). In order to check that the decreased band intensity in IKKβ expressing cells was due to accelerated degradation of IκBα, one set of cells were also treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 for 2 hours, resulting in equal IκBα protein levels in both the samples ( Figure 2C , lane 5 and 6). Aliquots of the sample were immunoblotted with anti-calnexin antibody to check equal loading. Thus, it appears that ORF2 expression prevents the degradation of IκBα. The fact that ORF2 did not interfere with phosphorylation of IκBα by the IKK complex was further confirmed by checking the activity of the IKK complex. ORF2 expressing cell lysate was immunoblotted for phospho IKKα/β (ser180/181) levels. As expected, ORF2 expression (2 or 4 μg plasmid DNA transfection) did not modulate the levels of pIKK α/β ( Figure 2D ).",
