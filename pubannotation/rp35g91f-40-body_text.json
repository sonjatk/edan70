    "text": "Gene network analysis effectively identifies markers expressed in the pulmonary myocardium from wholelung transcriptome data To confirm that our analyses have, in fact, identified genes expressed in the pulmonary myocardium, lung tissue samples were analyzed from four BALB/c mice using immunohistochemistry to detect the cellular localization of TNNI3 and ACTC1. ACTC1 was selected as its transcript was highly expressed in the lung data set (12.422 units) and was part of n our pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network (Table S3 in File S2). Further, Actc1 has previously been shown to be a direct target of NKX2-5 (Chen et al. 1996) . To differentiate between the pulmonary myocardium and typical smooth muscle, we also examined the localization of ACTA2. Cardiac ventricular tissue was used as a positive control for cardiomyocyte (TNNI3 and ACTC1) and smooth muscle (ACTA2) immunostaining ( Figure S2 in File S1). Distinct cell-type localization of TNNI3 and ACTA2 was observed in lung samples from four BALB/c mice (Figure 4 ; representative image from one mouse shown). A thin muscle coat staining positively for ACTA2 was situated beneath the columnar epithelium ( Figure 4A , black filled arrow) typical of bronchi and bronchioles in BALB/c mice (Rockx et al. 2007) . Consistent with previous reports describing the pulmonary vein myocardium (Kracklauer et al. 2013; Mueller-Hoecker et al. 2008 ), a thick muscle coat positively staining for TNNI3 was situated beneath a monolayer of endothelium lining the vein lumen (Mueller-Hoecker et al. 2008) ( Figure 4B , white filled arrow). This myocardial layer also stained positively for ACTC1 ( Figure 4C , white filled arrow), and contained visible striations ( Figure 4C , insert with Ãƒ ) previously reported to be evident in pulmonary vein myocardium (Kracklauer et al. 2013; Mueller-Hoecker et al. 2008) . Weak staining of ACTC1 but not TNNI3 was detected in bronchial smooth muscle cells (Figure 4 , B and C, black filled arrow). No positive staining was detected with an isotype control antibody ( Figure 4D ).",
