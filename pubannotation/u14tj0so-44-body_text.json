    "text": "In this example, method 4 of Iterative HFold outperforms the other methods. The input structure G has a high energy value and neither method 1 (HFold) nor method 2 (HFold-PKonly) can expand the pseudoknot-free structure to add the pseudoknotted stem. Also, by adding too many pseudoknot-free base pairs, method 3 fails to find the pseudoknotted base pairs. Thus, method 4 performs better than methods 1, 2 and 3.",
