    "text": "The concept of using clinically available drugs to treat new diseases is known as repurposing. In this method, a new target profile is created for the existing drugs through screening of large molecular databases. Owing to advances in computational approaches and development of effective antiviral agents, repurposing has become faster. Using high-throughput screening, researchers have been able to screen large libraries of drugs against novel targets and evaluate their antiviral activity in vitro [62, 63] . Some of repurposed drugs have shown potent antiviral activity against MERS-CoV, for example, ribavirin, nitazoxanide and hexachloropene [64] . Some other studies have repurposed the drugs by using a combination of two or more existing drugs. Wilde et al. combined alisporivir with ribavirin for enhanced antiviral activity against MERS and SARs-CoV [65] . In another study on MERS-CoV infected marmosets, hybrid of ritonavir/lopinavir and IFN-Î²1b had positive effect [66] .",
