    "text": "The NL4-3 [42] derived expression construct pNLenv1 [43] , the R5-tropic derivative carrying the 005pf135 V3 loop region in Env [44] and the p∆R construct [30] , harboring a mutational inactivation of the viral protease (PR − ) [32] , have been previously described. The expression plasmids encoding a codon optimized synthetic Gag polyprotein (syngag), which had developed from the HIV-1 HX10 isolate [45] , harboring wt p6 or mutants thereof, in which the two amino acid motifs PTAP have been exchanged to AIVA, have been described elsewhere [26, 46, 47] . The construct containing the ovalbumin-derived model epitope SIINFEKL (SL) in its p2 spacer region, syngag-SL, has been previously described [48, 49] . The plasmid for expression of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) was kindly provided by H.-G. Kräusslich and has been described elsewhere [30] .",
