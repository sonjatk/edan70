    "text": "Compared to countries with greater research effort on bats and bat-associated viruses (i.e., China, United States, Australia, and some European countries) (Figures 3, 5 and 6 ), Western Asia faces diverse systemic challenges that likely impede similar research in the region. Notably, ongoing armed conflict in several Western Asia countries, ranging from war in Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen to political instability in Iraq and Lebanon to Islamist militancy in Pakistan [131] , threaten the safety of wildlife researchers and have deprioritized government investments in wildlife or zoonotic disease research. Tragically, these conflicts have also directly impacted wildlife researchers, including the murder of a prominent mammalogist (and bat researcher) in Syria for unknown reasons [132] , as well as the continued imprisonment of nine Iranian researchers on suspicion of espionage, a crime punishable by death, for using camera traps to monitor the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah [133] . On the other hand, socio-political turbulence in the region has driven an increase in international concern for global health security. Yet, despite investments by local and foreign governments to support biosafety and biosecurity programs in the region, there remains limited capacity and unequal access to critical infrastructure and resources to improve biosurveillance across Western Asia [134] . Furthermore, until very recently, this region was a low priority for wildlife research funding, and what funding was available for wildlife research was targeted to the conservation of more charismatic species (e.g., Arabian Oryx, Asiatic cheetah).
