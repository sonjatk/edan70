The experimental protocols in this study were approved by the Animal Experiment Committee of Nagoya University (approval number: 29154), and were carried out in accordance with the Regulations on Animal Experiments in Nagoya University. Pregnant ICR (CD-1) mice (7-8 weeks) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Kanagawa, Japan). All mice were allowed free access to food and water and were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 9:00 AM). The pregnant mice were assigned randomly to three groups of five dams each: Control group, LPS group, and HW + LPS group (Fig. 6) , as in our previous report 12 . All pregnant mice, except for those in the Control group, received an intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) of 75 Î¼g of LPS dissolved in sterile saline on E17. In the Control group, the pregnant mice were injected with an equal volume of sterile saline. In the HW + LPS group, the pregnant mice were administered HW, beginning 24 h before LPS injection and continuing until parturition. HW was aliquoted in glass drinking bottles to prevent H 2 degassing as well as air refilling. Offspring growth evaluation and behavioral testing. As shown in Fig. 6 , after birth, all offspring were housed with their mother until P19, when they were weaned, as previously reported 76, 77 . We only used male offspring in all of the experiments because of previously reported sex effects 43 . All animals were left undisturbed except for measuring body weights and weekly cage changes. Body weight was recorded at P4, 6, 8, 10, 13, 16, and 19 . The order of the behavioral tests was as follows: (1) Y-maze test at postnatal 3 weeks 78 ; and (2) three-chamber sociability and social novelty test 79 and PPI test at postnatal 4 weeks, according to previous reports (Fig. 6 ). All behavioral tests were conducted between 1 PM and 8 PM.",
