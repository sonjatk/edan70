    "text": "We used western blots to confirm that each HCV protein was expressed in cell lines. Each of seven proteins -the core, E1, E2, NS3-4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B -was recognized and labeled by a separate cognate antibody directed ( Figure S3 ). To induce effective immune responses against HCV proteins in transgenic mice, we injected an rVV-HCV (rVV-CN2, rVV-CN5, or rVV-N25) or LC16m8 (as the control) intradermally into CN2-29 (+/2) / MxCre (+/2) mice 90 days after poly(I:C) injection ( Figure 2B ). Analysis of liver sections 7 days after immunization with rVV-N25 revealed dramatic improvement in a variety of pathological findings associated with chronic hepatitis -including piecemeal necrosis, hepatocyte swelling, abnormal architecture of liver-cell cords, abnormal accumulation of glycogen, and steatosis ( Figures 2C-E) . Collectively, these results demonstrated that only the rVV-N25 treatment resulted in histological changes indicative of improvement in the chronic hepatitis suffered by the transgenic mice.",
