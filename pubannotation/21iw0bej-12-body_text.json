    "text": "All work was carried out in a designated PCR-clean area as previously described (Yu et al.) . RNA was extracted from infected and uninfected cells using Trizol reagent (Gibco-BRL, Rockville, Md.) and isolated as specified by the manufacturer. The RNA was DNAse-treated (DNase I-RNase-Free, Ambion) to remove any contaminating DNA; 200 ng of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with oligo dT primers using the High Capacity cDNA RT Kit (Applied Biosystems) in a 20 µl cDNA reaction, as specified by the manufacturer. For quantitative PCR, the template cDNA was added to a 20 µl reaction with SYBR GREEN PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 0.2 µM of primer ( Table 1) . The amplification was carried out using an ABI Prism 7000 for 40 cycles under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 95 • C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95 • C for 15 s and 60 • C for 1 min. The fold changes were calculated relative to GAPDH using the Ct method.",
