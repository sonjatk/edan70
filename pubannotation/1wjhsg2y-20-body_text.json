    "text": "Several countries in Western Asia face a multitude of economic, political, and security challenges that can hinder wildlife research, and likely contribute to a lack of research effort across the region. To highlight the gap in research effort on bats and their associated viruses, including coronaviruses, in Western Asia we conducted a literature review of specific search terms by country in PubMed (see Figures 3, 5 and 6 ). PubMed is a freely available literature database containing nearly 30 million citations dating from 1948 to 2019, and is maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [120] . We extracted the number of publications per country indexed in PubMed using package rentrez [121] based on the following combinations of search terms: (1) (\"bat\" OR \"bats\" OR \"Chiroptera\" [All Fields]), (2) (\"bat\" OR \"bats\" OR \"Chiroptera\" [All Fields]) AND (\"virus\" OR \"viruses\" [All Fields]), and (3) (\"bat\" OR \"bats\" OR \"Chiroptera\" [All Fields]) AND (\"coronavirus\" OR \"coronaviruses\" [All Fields]) ( Table 1 ). Counts of publications that include specific search terms were mapped using packages rworldmap [122] and viridis [108] in R version 3.4.3 [109] .",
