    "text": "Alternatively, IFITMs have been proposed to sterically rigidify membranes in which they insert leading to fusion inhibition, as recently proposed [26] . This hypothesis is supported by the finding that IFITMs can interact between themselves, although the extent of this multimerization has not been fully examined [49] . Whether these mechanisms are at play here and more importantly whether the same mechanism/s of inhibition is at play in target cells and in virion particles remains to be determined.",
