    "text": "The oils from young and mature leaves of Ageratum scoparia Waldst. & Kit. displayed a high degree of hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. However, the scavenging activity of principle constituents, Î²-myrcene and p-cymene, was very less compared to that of oils. The same authors [83] also evaluated the antioxidant activity of the samples by the DPPH method and also reported less activity of the main constituents of the oils than the essential oils, nevertheless the mature leaf oils were more effective as antioxidants than young leaf oils.",
