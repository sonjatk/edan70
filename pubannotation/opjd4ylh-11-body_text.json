The researcher explained the purpose of the study to each participant before interviewing them. Participants were assured that confidentiality will be maintained. The interview dates and times were arranged with participants prior to data collection date. Data collection took place between April-July 2015. The interviews were conducted early in the morning as suggested by participants before they could start with their duties to avoid distracting them from their normal ward routine work. Separate interviews with six participants took place in a private office within TB wards at the regional hospital, and each lasted approximately 30 min. All interviews were conducted by the researcher. All interviews started with an opening question: \"What is your experience when nursing patients who suffer from TB?\"",
