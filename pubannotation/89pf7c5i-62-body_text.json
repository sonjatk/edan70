    "text": "Allopurinol is generally well tolerated; however, in one cat, elevation of hepatic enzymes was reported at 10 mg/kg BID and the dose was reduced to 5 mg/kg BID [56] . Clinical improvement was observed in most cases treated with allopurinoleven in FIV positive cats -within a few weeks after treatment was initated [37, 50, 64] or slowly after 6 months [56] . A long term follow-up was available in some cats treated with allopurinol. A clinical cure was obtained in these cats but relapse occurred after discontinuation of treatment, suggesting that they were still infected [14, 37, 55] . Clinical worsening leading to euthanasia occurred in a few cases after a few weeks of therapy [54, 57] .",
