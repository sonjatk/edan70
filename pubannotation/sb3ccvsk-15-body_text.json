    "text": "While neither CNS antiviral function nor demyelination were affected by Foxp3 + Treg depletion, a potential increase in virus-specific and SR CD4 + T cells may be unapparent due to their low frequencies in the CNS. Specifically, SR CD4 + T cell frequencies are low within the CNS, although higher than in CLN (13) . To verify that their increased numbers in CLN do not lead to enhanced circulation and recruitment to the CNS, we used ELISPOT to determine frequencies of both virus-specific and SR T cells in the CNS. Frequencies as well as total numbers of IFN-γ secreting M 133 -specific CD4 + T cells were indeed similar in the CNS of both groups (Figure 5) . Contrasting the CLN, both frequencies and total numbers of IFN-γ secreting MOG 35−55 -and MBP 60−80 -specific CD4 + T cells were also identical within the CNS of DT-treated DTR − and DTR + mice ( Figure 5) . These data were consistent with similar demyelination and supported a limited role for Foxp3 + Tregs in controlling the CNS SR CD4 + T cell response during chronic JHMV infection.",
