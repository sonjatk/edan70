    "text": "Dampness may also be created by condensation and may thus increase at higher ventilation rates. Carbon monoxide is lethal at high exposure levels and more efficient dilution by higher ventilation may not be sufficient. However, for all these pollutants the benefits of higher ventilation rates are calculated assuming the mass-balance for a constant source term.",
