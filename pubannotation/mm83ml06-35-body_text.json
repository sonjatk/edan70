    "text": "In this study, we observed that DIs cause a general Gag processing defect. One explanation for this phenomenon would be that DIs directly inhibit the viral protease. However, this possibility could be excluded as in vitro processing assays revealed that the applied DIs, even at high concentrations, had no effect on the viral protease. Another explanation might be that polyubiquitin chains conjugated to Gag sterically disturb the highly ordered lattice of assembling Gag and thus exert a negative effect on the highly ordered Gag-assembly during virus budding, and eventually also on the auto-activation of the viral protease. Another possibility may be the direct masking of the viral protease cleavage sites by bulky polyubiquitin adducts. Accumulation of processing intermediates has been shown previously to interfere with viral infectivity in a trans-dominant negative manner [61] , which is in concert with our observations that treatment with DIs P22077 and PR-619 reduces virus infectivity in a dose-dependent manner.",
