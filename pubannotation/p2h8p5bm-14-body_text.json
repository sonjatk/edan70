    "text": "TBFVs are enveloped viruses around 50 nm in diameter. The envelope carries two surface proteins, the envelope (E) protein and the membrane (M) protein. The latter is derived from a precursor protein, prM. The nucleocapsid (NC) lies inside the viral envelope and consists of multiple copies of capsid (C) protein and the viral genome. The TBFV genomes are single stranded, positive-sense RNA of approximately 11,000 nucleotides. It has a 5 -cap with a single open reading frame (ORF). The ORF is flanked by 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTRs). The viral protein is encoded by the ORF as a single polyprotein, which is co-and post-translationally cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into individual viral proteins (three structural and seven non-structural). The polyprotein is arranged in the order 5 -C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5-3 [70, 71] .",
