    "text": "Protective properties of type I IFN against viruses originate from their ability to trigger the production of potent antiviral proteins in nearby cells. The expression of one of these antiviral proteins, the Mx GTPase, is known to be directly stimulated by type I IFN and can be used as marker for the induction of intracellular antiviral mechanisms by these cytokines in cats as well as in other species [19, 64] . Thus, as detection of feline type I IFN on a protein level is rendered difficult by the unavailability of antibodies specifically recognizing these proteins, mRNA levels of Mx were measured in feline PBMCs after stimulation with ODN 2216, as indication for production of type I IFN. Transcription of Mx was significantly enhanced and remained proportional to mRNA expression of type I IFN in stimulated PBMCs of individual cats ( Figure 4A ",
