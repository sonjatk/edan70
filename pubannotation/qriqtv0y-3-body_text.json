    "text": "During September 2016 to September 2018, we conducted a survey of viral enteric diseases in domestic dogs in small animal hospitals in 5 provinces of Thailand (Bangkok, Nakhon Ratchasima, Ratchaburi, Suphanburi, and Tak). We tested 307 rectal swab samples for CaKoV by using one-step RT-PCR specific to 3D gene. Based on a two-year survey, we found CaKoV positivity at 17.59% (54/307). CaKoVs could be detected in both sick (19.44% (49/252)) and healthy (9.09% (5/55)) animals. Our result showed no seasonal pattern of CaKoV infection in dogs (Figs. 1 and 2). In relation to age group, CaKoV could be frequently detected in younger dogs at 25.45% (42/165) (Additional file 2: Table S2 ). The coinfections of CaKoV with other enteric viral pathogens were observed including CaKoV/Canine parvovirus/Canine Coronavirus (n = 6), CaKoV/Canine parvovirus (n = 20) and CaKoV/Canine Coronavirus (n = 2). In this study, 12 CaKoVs were selected and characterized by whole genome sequencing (n = 4) or 3D and VP1 gene sequencing (n = 8). The viruses were selected to represent epidemiological and demographic data such as age, date of isolation and breed. In this study, nucleotide sequences of the CaKoV were submitted to the GenBank database under the accession numbers MK201776 -MK201795 (Table 1) .",
