    "text": "Despite the considerable literature on potential mechanisms of viral-bacterial interactions that may lead to pneumonia, most studies are limited to experiments conducted in animal models using select viral and bacterial strains, which may not reflect what is occurring in human populations. Furthermore, the interactions between virus and bacteria are undoubtedly far more complex than identified in animal models, and likely consists of a complex web of interactions between different viruses and bacteria with viruses similar to that described in the URT [12, 26] . Even after considering these limitations, the overwhelming evidence for the existence of multiple biological mechanisms under various conditions supports our second hypothesis that respiratory viruses can alter bacterial selection in the LRT and is an important factor in pneumonia etiology.",
