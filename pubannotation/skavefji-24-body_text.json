    "text": "A strength of the current study is the relatively strict enrollment criteria used. To minimize bias associated with antimicrobial therapy, all patients who received antimicrobial therapy for more than 24 hours were excluded, regardless of the adequacy of prior antimicrobial therapy. By using strict enrollment criteria, however, only a small proportion of pneumonia patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL was finally included (Figure 1 ), which might have influenced on the results. However, positive likelihood and negative likelihood ratio, which are not influenced by disease prevalence, were good, which supports the validity of the data. In clinical practice, the results might be applied to patients who have received antimicrobial therapy more than 24 hours. That is, if BAL fluid cellular analysis shows evident pleocytosis even after antimicrobial therapy for more than 24 hours, it would be a strong suggestion for bacterial etiology.",
