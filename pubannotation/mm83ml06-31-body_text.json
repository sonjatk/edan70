    "text": "Despite the tremendous effort that has been made to improve the classical, combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), which mainly blocks mutation-prone viral targets, there is an increasing risk for treatment failure resulting from drug resistance, incompliance, and adverse effects. While there is still a great medical need for continuous development of novel antiretroviral drugs [85] , the focus is currently on cellular targets that are genetically a million times more stable and thus harbor a much lower risk of drug resistance [86, 87] . Small molecules, which affect cellular targets, offer a treatment alternative for interruption of cART in case of drug intolerance or development of multi-resistant HIV-1 variants. In this study, we could provide first evidence that the DIs P22077 and PR-619 not only block the replication of the HIV-1 T cell culture adapted molecular clone NL4-3, but also of the multi-resistant field isolate HIV-1 4lig7, which possesses resistance against all NRTIs and most of the protease inhibitors used in cART [50, 51] . Moreover, we could demonstrate that structural treatment with DIs P22077 and PR-619 on day 1 and 3 post infection can completely block spread of infection with similar efficacy as permanent treatment and without affecting cell viability. This indicates that a complete and comprehensive block in the production of progeny viruses, occurring early during spread of infection in the cell culture, must have been achieved by DI treatment that efficiently enables eradication of virus replication. One explanation for this observation might be the reduced infectivity of virions released under DI treatment, which is most likely due to impaired Gag processing. However, additional impact of DIs on HIV-1 genomic RNA packaging, or the incorporation of the Env glycoprotein into budding virions, as well as on the activities of regulatory proteins, like Tat, Rev or Vif, might also account for this phenomenon.",
