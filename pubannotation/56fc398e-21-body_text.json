    "text": "After reconstructing the movement network, epidemics were seeded randomly in Cumbria, Aberdeenshire or Devon. These three counties have a high number of cattle farms and livestock movements, and therefore epidemics starting in these counties are more likely to produce a high number of cases than in other parts of the UK. Cumbria and Devon were also two major hotspots of infection during the UK FMD outbreak in 2001 [3] . A random source farm in each county was infected initially for each simulation, and we investigated the predicted final epidemic size, duration, peak size and the model prediction of the geographical spread of disease.",
