    "text": "Then, the newly extended LMDI method based on the Kaya identity was adopted to examine the main drivers for the carbon emissions increments both at the industrial sector and the residential sector in Guangzhou city. Quantitative analyses and time-series analysis were performed on the influencing mechanism for various influencing factors both at the industrial sector and the residential sector for the three different development periods, namely, the 10 th five-year plan period (2003) (2004) (2005) , the 11 th five-year plan period (2005-2010), and the 12 th five-year plan period (2010-2013). The influences and impacts of various driving factors on industrial and residential carbon emissions are different in the three different development periods. Overall, the affluence effect (g-effect) was the dominant positive effect in driving carbon emissions increase, while the energy intensity effect of production (e-effect-Production), the economic structure effect (s-effect) and the carbon intensity effect of production (f-effect-Production) were the main contributing factors suppressing the carbon emission growth at the industrial sector. Considering the high urbanization level in Guangzhou, the affluence effect of urban (g-effect-AUI) was the most dominant positive driving factor on the carbon emissions increment, while the energy intensity effect of urban (e-effect-Urban) played the most important role in curbing carbon emissions growth at the residential sector.",
