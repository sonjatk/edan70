    "text": "To investigate the effects of eEF1A on the CSFV replication, stable PK-15 cell line overexpressing EGFP-eEF1A (PK-EGFP-eEF1A) or EGFP (PK-EGFP) was generated and infected with the CSFV Shimen strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. The N pro expression in the CSFV-infected PK-EGFP-eEF1A cells was decreased at 48 and 72 h post-infection (hpi), compared with that in the PK-EGFP cells ( Figure 3A ,B). Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that the viral genome copies in the PK-EGFP-eEF1A cells were also reduced at 48 and 72 hpi, compared with the PK-EGFP cells ( Figure 3C ). Additionally, yields of infectious virus in culture supernatant of PK-EGFP-eEF1A cells were decreased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 3D ). The results indicated the eEF1A negatively modulates the CSFV replication.",
