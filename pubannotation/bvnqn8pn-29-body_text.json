    "text": "A personalized written action plan, meaning a document explaining how to deal with the condition, particularly in the event of an attack, and when to refer to the doctor or the emergency services, is widely accepted as good practice in asthma education and self-management [30] . According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, providing patients with such a plan is a quality indicator and can improve outcomes such as self-efficacy, knowledge, and confidence for people with asthma. In those who have had a recent exacerbation, resulting in admission to hospital, it may reduce readmission rates [31] . Quite recently, a survey was conducted among 277 pediatricians in 6 European countries to assess the care for asthmatic children in the outpatients' setting in terms of therapeutic education; it turned out that 80% of the sampled patients received a personalized action plan during the visit (83% in Italy) [32] . Several papers consider the availability of an individualized action plan among the interventions that can help reducing ED visits for acute asthma [2, 20, 21] . Some authors also suggest the use of electronic action plans that might be delivered to the patients at ED discharge [33] .",
