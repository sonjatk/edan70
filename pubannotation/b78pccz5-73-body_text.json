    "text": "This can be seen when comparing the sources of the burden of disease in Finland ( Figure 3 ) and in other EU-26 countries (Table 4 ) with the population-weighted mean of EU-26 countries. It is readily apparent that in Finland the role of ambient particles is lower than in Europe in general, but that both bio-aerosols (pollen) and radon play much more significant roles. Especially the contribution of radon is double to that of the European average, highlighting the geology peculiarities of the Finnish soil.",
