    "text": "cOnclUsiOn Results of this study suggest that gastrointestinal therapeutic diets alone can be effective in the management of cats with chronic vomiting associated with a chronic gastroenteropathy. Cats that do not respond to dietary therapy require further diagnostics and/or medical therapy to adequately characterize and manage the underlying disease. Additionally, cats that do not respond to gastrointestinal formulas may respond to diets formulated with limited novel ingredients or hydrolyzed protein sources.",
