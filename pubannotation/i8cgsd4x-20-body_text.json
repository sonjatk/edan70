    "text": "CxCul4, ortholog of mammalian Cullin4A/B, has previously been shown to be responsible for degradation of STAT via ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases are responsible for ubiquitylation of target proteins. To determine whether degradation of CxSTAT via CxCul4 occurs by ubiquitylation, Culex cells were transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4 (or GFP dsRNA as control). The cells were infected with WNV and cell lysates collected 48 hours post-infection. Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-ubiquitin antibody, followed by Western blot using anti-ubiquitin and anti-CxSTAT antibodies. The results (Fig 5E) showed that STAT was co-immunoprecipitated with ubiquitin after WNV infection in control (GFP dsRNA) cells, indicating ubiquitylation of CxSTAT. CxSTAT was not co-immunoprecipitated with ubiquitin in cells transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4. The results suggest that CxCul4 plays a major role in ubiquitylation of CxSTAT after WNV infection.",
