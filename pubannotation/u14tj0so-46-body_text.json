    "text": "One of our goals is to understand the degree to which our methods are robust with respect to partial information, that is, provide a reliable prediction even when limited information about the true pseudoknot-free structure, G big , is available. For this purpose we generate subset structures of the corresponding G big , for each RNA sequence in the HK-PK and HK-PK-free data sets. For each α, 0.05 ≤ α ≤ 0.95 with 0.05 steps, we choose each base pair of G big structure with probability α. We also generate 1% information and 99% information about the G big structure (i.e., α = 0.01 and α = 0.99). We repeat this step 100 times to generate 100 substructures of G big for each value of α for each RNA sequence in our data sets. We then run our methods on all 100 substructures for each RNA sequence in our data sets and α value and calculate the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval for average F-measure of these 100 cases as the accuracy interval for each method and each RNA sequence and α value in our data set. We also compare our methods when the true pseudoknot-free structure, G big is provided.",
