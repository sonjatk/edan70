    "text": "example, method 2 of Iterative HFold outperforms method 1: although both HFold and HFold PKonly produce the same result on sequence S and input structure G, namely the structure G ∪ G , the additional iteration in method 2, in which HFold is run with S and G , finds a structure with lower energy than that of G ∪ G . Method 3: First run SimFold on S and G to obtain result G -a pseudoknot-free structure that contains G. Then let G updated be the secondary structure of S containing the relaxed stems of G that include the base pairs of G. By a relaxed stem, we mean a secondary structure containing stacked base pairs, bulges of size 1 and internal loops of maximum size of 3 (i.e., either the symmetric loop of 1 × 1 or the non-symmetric loop of 1 × 2 or 2 × 1 but no other loop types; this is motivated by common practice [65] ). Then run method 2 on S and G updated , and store the result. See Example 2.",
