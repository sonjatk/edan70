    "text": "In the present study, we identified a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype H2-d restricted peptide epitope in the MERS-CoV N protein by stimulating T cells from MVA-MERS-N vaccinated BALB/c mice with a 2-D matrix pool of overlapping peptides. These mice have already been used in various preclinical studies to establish the MERS-CoV S protein as an important vaccine antigen for induction of virus neutralizing antibodies [23, [40] [41] [42] 54] . Moreover, BALB/c mice transduced with the human cell surface receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) using an adenovirus vector are susceptible to productive MERS-CoV lung infection, which allows for the testing of the protective efficacy of MERS-CoV-specific immunization using the MERS-CoV S protein [24, 40, 41, 43, 44] . Here, we wished to specifically assess the suitability of an MVA-delivered MERS-CoV N antigen for the activation of cellular immune responses in mice. In general, the N protein is a well conserved internal protein and the major structural component incorporating the viral RNA within the viral nucleocapsid [55] . In previous studies, the SARS-CoV N protein has also been used as candidate antigen for vaccine development [56] , and an experimental DNA vaccine efficiently induced SARS-CoV N-specific cellular immunity [57, 58] . In line with this data, recent studies in MERS patients demonstrated that both antibody and T cell responses are associated with recovery from MERS-CoV infection [59] .",
