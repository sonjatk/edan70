    "text": "The properties of the underlying network may have a significant effect on epidemic dynamics [39] . We therefore consider how network properties change as fewer data are used by the various sampling schemes. We first consider the number of strongly connected components of the network. A subset of nodes forms a strongly connected component if each of the nodes can connect to each other node by following a path which preserves edge direction. If the largest of these components is of the same order as the complete network it is known as the giant strongly connected component (GSCC) and gives a lower bound to the maximum size of an outbreak on the network if the disease is perfectly transmissible [33] . In addition, we explore the impact of the sampling schemes upon the mean and standard deviation of the weighted w and unweighted k degree of nodes in the GSCC. Finally, we investigate the tendency for similar nodes to connect to each other through degree assortativity [40, 41] . These statistics are averaged over 1000 realizations of the network for each sampling method. The diameter of the GSCC was also measured but, owing to extensive computational time, this was only calculated for a single realization of the network. The diameter of a network is the length of the longest shortest path across the network [40] . As well as the network statistics mentioned previously, we also explore the number of nodes and edges captured by the various sampling schemes as the percentage of sampled data varies.",
