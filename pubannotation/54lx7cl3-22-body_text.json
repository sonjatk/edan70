    "text": "The greatest difficulty in addressing our hypotheses was our inability to determine the relative contributions of URT bacterial community structure and local host defenses on bacterial selection into the LRT. In the simplest case, how much is the risk of pneumonia following viral infection attributable to the presence of a known bacterial pneumonia pathogen (such as S. pneumoniae) in the URT? To determine this, studies must examine timedependent carriage of bacteria, species-specific pneumonia outcomes and the effects of viral coinfection among other known risk factors-which, to the best of our knowledge, do not currently exist. Nonetheless, the literature strongly supports the presence of an interaction between viral infection and secondary bacterial pneumonia; the failure to fully understand the mechanisms should act as a spur for future studies while continuing current efforts to reduce the worldwide burden of pneumonia.",
