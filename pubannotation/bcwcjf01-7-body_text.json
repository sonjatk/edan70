    "text": "To test our hypothesis and better understand the evolution of rabies, we applied deep-sequencing to 44 unpassaged rabies virus samples from the Humboldt epizootic. Sequence data were generated by two different platforms (Illumina and 454) and by three different commercial services to determine reproducibility. For 40 of the samples, approximately 11 kb of the 12 kb genome was amplified and sequenced using the Illumina platform (the remaining 4 samples were sequenced using the 454 platform only). Average coverage was 17,4486 and this allowed characterization of the rabies virus population present in each sample at unprecedented depths.",
