    "text": "The characteristics of the 47 patients are shown in Table 1 . Thirty-two patients (68.1%) were men and the mean age was 62.1 years. Structural lung disease was the most common underlying disease (29.8%), followed by diabetes mellitus (19.0%), and hematologic malignancy/solid cancer (both 12.8%). Sixteen patients (34.0%) had CAP, 25 (53.2%) had HCAP, and 6 (12.8%) had HAP. Most baseline characteristics did not significantly differ between the bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia groups. By contrast, mean APACHE II (27.066.8 vs. 20.865.3, P = .002) and SOFA (11.363.7 vs. 7.663.2, P = .001) scores were significantly higher in the bacterial pneumonia group than in the viral pneumonia group. However, mortality rates, including 28-day mortality, did not significantly differ between the groups.",
