    "text": "We measured binding of antibodies either to virus directly coated on ELISA-plate wells or to solubilized Env. For the direct virus binding assay, plates were coated with HIV-1 JR-FL (20 ng p24/well) for 2 hours at 37uC, washed with PBS and blocked with 4% non-fat dry milk in PBS. After 1 hour at 37uC, plates were washed, antibodies were added in serial dilutions and incubated for 1 hour at 37uC. Detector antibody (horse radish peroxidaselabeled goat anti-human Fc) was added to the washed plate and incubated for 45 min at 37uC. Finally, plates were washed, developed (TMB solution, Life Technologies), and read at 450 nm using a plate reader (BioTek).",
