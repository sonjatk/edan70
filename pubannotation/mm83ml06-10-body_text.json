    "text": "HeLa cells were lysed with RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail, NEM, and PMSF. Lysates were adjusted to 1% SDS (w/v) and incubated at 95 • C for 10 min, subsequently diluted to 0.1% SDS and were then cleared by centrifugation at 20,000× g for 10 min. Gag content was recovered by immunoprecipitation with antibodies derived from HIV-1 patient sera pre-bound to GammaBind Plus Sepharose (GE Healthcare). For detection of ubiquitinated Gag proteins directly by western blotting, RIPA lysis buffer was supplemented with 20 µM lactacystin and 20 µM carbobenzoxyl-leucine-leucine-leucinal.",
