    "text": "According to the findings of the present study, TB patients spread TB in the wards and outside. The nurses indicated that they feel vulnerable, since they are at great risk of contracting TB. The nurses indicated that patients continue to spread infection, even when they are outside TB wards and that contributes to an outbreak of TB in rural areas. The findings of this study concur with those of the study done by Arjun [25] , which concluded that TB patients are a risk to community members because when they go to shopping centers and places where there are large numbers of people, such as social gatherings and church services they become a danger to the people.",
