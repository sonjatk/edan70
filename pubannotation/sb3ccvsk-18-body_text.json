    "text": "Irrespective of the overall common suppressive action in draining LN during viral infection, the function of endogenous Foxp3 + Treg migrating to and residing in the CNS throughout persistence remains obscure. Despite the prolonged reduction of Tregs by DT-mediated depletion, we found no evidence of altered pathogenesis. Regulation of the CNS autoimmune responses by Foxp3 + Tregs is also ineffective during EAE (48) . Despite Foxp3 + Treg accumulation within the inflamed CNS, their functions were abrogated by pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF. Expression of both cytokines during JHMV infection (49) suggests they may have similar suppressive activity on local Foxp3 + Treg. Alternatively, a potential deficit of Foxp3 + Treg access to CNS demyelinating lesions, with perivascular retention, may explain their inability to regulate CNS inflammation and will require further investigation. It is also possible that residual Foxp3 + Tregs detected 1 week after DT treatment may be sufficient to control CNS inflammation. The minor Foxp3 + Treg population detected at day 28 p.i. presumably comprises rebound Tregs, as well as a small proportion of DT insensitive Foxp3 + cells detected in adult DEREG mice (23) . While rebound Tregs are dysfunctional (28), DT-resistant Foxp3 + Tregs have been shown to protect against lethal autoimmunity and may thus suffice to control the SR CD4 + T cells during chronic JHMV infection (23) . It nevertheless remains intriguing that residual Foxp3 + Tregs in CLN appear to exert more potent suppressive capacities than in the CNS. In contrast to the lack of Foxp3 + Treg suppressive function within the CNS, IL-27R −/− mice displayed increased virus and SR CD4 + T cell responses, implicating Tr1 cells as a major regulator of CNS inflammation during chronic JHMV infection. Impaired IL-27 signaling was associated with decreased IL-10 + virus-specific CD4 + T cells and delayed viral control (15) . The present results indeed confirmed that Tr1 cells dampened the virus-specific Th1 cell response within the CNS. However, a greater increase of SR CD4 + T cells was observed in the CNS of IL-27R −/− mice, indicating that Tr1 cells are also critical in limiting autoimmunity during chronic JHMV infection. It remains to be determined whether Tr1 cells restricting SR CD4 + T cell response during chronic JHMV infection are myelin-specific, as Tr1 regulatory function efficacy was shown to be dependent upon antigen specificity (50, 51) . The mechanisms associated with Tr1-dependent suppression of CNS SR T cells may involve IL-10 secretion, granzyme B, and perforin production, inhibitory molecule expression, or metabolic regulation (52) . Finally, the implication of SR CD4 + T cells in promoting tissue damage and clinical autoimmunity during JHMV infection remain unclear, as increased myelin-specific CD4 + T cells in IL-27R −/− mice correlated with a moderate decrease, rather than expected increase in demyelination (15) . It cannot be excluded that despite their increased frequency, the overall low numbers of myelin-specific CD4 + T cells are insufficient to achieve effector threshold levels required to affect myelin loss or tissue damage. Prolonged studies may be necessary to reveal altered tissue damage, as demyelination in IL-27R −/− mice was quantified only until day 30 p.i. (15) . It also remains a possibility that compensatory mechanisms occur in the absence of Tr1 cells. IL-10 is critical in limiting demyelination during JHMV persistence and is produced by both Foxp3 + Tregs and Tr1 cells. Surprisingly however, no difference in IL-10 mRNA levels was detected between WT and IL-27R −/− mice during chronic JHMV infection (42) , indicating another cell type may compensate for the lack of Tr1 cells.",
