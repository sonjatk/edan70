    "text": "As virus release remained unaffected, one explanation for the defect in Gag processing would be direct inhibition of the HIV-1 PR by the DIs PR-619 or P22077. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of these DIs on the in vitro processing of HIV-1 Gag. Purified VLPs derived from the p∆R PR − construct [32] , encoding a protease deficient HIV-1 mutant virus, were lysed and incubated with 2.56 µM of the HIV-1 PR. No effect on the protease activity was observed for PR-619 or P22077 ( In contrast, addition of the DI P5091, which is selective for USP7, had no influence on Gag processing ( Figure 1B ). Densitometric analyses of the western blot data illustrate that the efficacy of Gag processing was reduced by about 2-fold in cells treated with P22077 or PR-619, whereas cells treated with the DI P5091 had wt level ( Figure 1C ), indicating that certain DUB activities regulate late steps of HIV replication. Although the DI P22077 and PR-619 clearly reduced Gag processing, none of the inhibitors had any influence on the efficiency of VLP release ( Figure 1D ). ",
