    "text": "According to the findings of the present study TB nurses feel unappreciated for what they are doing. TB nurses are on the frontline of the fight against the highly infectious diseases that affect many people. In spite of this, they do not receive a danger allowance and the hospital does not celebrate TB day as a way of appreciating TB nurses as pioneers in the hospitals who risk their lives in order to fight TB disease. In support of these findings, Loghmani et al. [29] reported that the participants' experiences were that the families believed that nurses did not do their best for the patients and that they abused the patients. The findings of this study concur with those of the study by Sodeify et al. [30] , which concluded that South African nurses were not well supported, appreciated, recognized, and well-rewarded; unlike in other countries since they provide quality service to patients under very difficult circumstances with limited resources. This is why they leave South Africa to work in other countries.",
