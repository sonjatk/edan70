    "text": "Rodentia is the largest mammalian order and is comprised of about 1,800 species [10] . Only a few dozen species have been identified as susceptible hosts, and most hantaviruses are hosted by a single rodent species [11] . In each hantavirus/rodent reservoir relationship, infection results in two prominent features: no conspicuous pathology and persistent infection [12] [13] [14] . The earliest report of experimental infection of a reservoir host with its hantavirus was by Lee et al. [15] that described infection of striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius) with Hantaan virus. Inoculated mice developed chronic infection with transient viremia, and shed virus principally in urine, saliva and, to a lesser extent, feces, despite the production of neutralizing antibodies.",
