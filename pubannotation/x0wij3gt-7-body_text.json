    "text": "The human bronchial epithelial cell lines BEAS-2B and HBEc14-KT were obtained from John Minna (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA). They were maintained in KERATINOCYTE-SFM medium (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with human recombinant epidermal growth factor 1-53 (EGF 1-53) and bovine pituitary extract (BPE). Cells were plated into six-well culture plates at an initial seeding density of 5 × 10 4 cells per well. The plates were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 in air at 37°C. Lipofectamine 2000 reagent was purchased from Invitrogen. The CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit was purchased from Promega. Polyclonal antibodies against PDK1 and phosphorylated PDK1 (ser 241) were purchased from Cell Signaling. The polyclonal antibody against c-Jun was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Polyclonal antibody against EP4, a 16, 16-Dimethyl-PGE 2 (dmPGE2) solution in methyl acetate and AH23848, OSU-03012 were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co.",
