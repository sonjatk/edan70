    "text": "We run IPknot using the provided source code and the default parameters for scoring model and level (i.e., scoring model = McCaskill and level = 2). The default values provided for base pair weights are not the same on the IPknot website (i.e., γ 1 = 2 and γ 2 = 16), its source code (i.e., for some cases γ 1 = 2 and γ 2 = 4 and for others γ 1 = 1 and γ 2 = 1) and the provided perl script (i.e., γ 1 = 4 and γ 2 = 8). We run IPknot with all of these values with and without refinement and provide IPknot's bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for average F-measures for all of our data sets as a table in the Additional file 2. Based on its performance we present IPknot's results with default settings (i.e., no refinement, scoring model = McCaskill and level = 2) and γ 1 = 4 and γ 2 = 8, for comparison with other methods.",
