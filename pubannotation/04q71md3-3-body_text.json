    "text": "Notable recent examples include novel influenza strains, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, which all exploit today's complex and voluminous transport networks to rapidly disseminate in a globalized world. In the context of human infectious diseases, the worldwide air transportation network is by far the best studied system of global mobility [2] . Air travel likely drives the global circulation of seasonal influenza A (H3N2) viruses [3] , and may explain seasonal dynamics in the absence of locally-persistent strains between epidemic seasons. Retrospective modeling of the 'Hong Kong flu' H3N2 pandemic in 1968 indicates that the virus spread through a global network of cities interconnected by air travel [4] . Numerous modeling and simulation studies have subsequently explored the potential influence of air travel on influenza virus spread, e.g. [5] [6] [7] [8] , but few have attempted to verify such models against underlying empirical data on human movement patterns [9] .",
