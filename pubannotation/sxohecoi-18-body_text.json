    "text": "We next determined whether IgG purified from cervicovaginal fluid and from seminal fluid could enhance transcytosis at low pH. Using IgG from cervicovaginal fluid of three HIV-infected women and from seminal fluid of three infected men, enhanced transcytosis occurred at IgG concentrations well within their expected range in genital tract secretions ( Figure 4A and 4B) [18] . The ability of genital tract IgG to mediate transcytosis correlated strongly with infectious virus capture activity by the IgG (Spearman's rho = 0.94, p = 0.005; Figure 4C ) and less so with binding to monomeric Env glycoprotein from the same virus strain (HIV-1 US657 ) (rho = 0.65, p = 0.16; Figure S6 ). None of the genital tract IgGs were able to neutralize HIV US657 , the clinical R5 strain used in these experiments, at IgG concentrations as high as 50 mg/ ml (not shown). Consistent with HIVIG and the non-neutralizing mAbs, higher concentrations of genital tract IgGs generally resulted in greater infectivity of the transcytosed virus ( Figure 4D and 4E).",
