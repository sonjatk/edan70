    "text": "Bat research networks have increased in number, largely as collaborative efforts to combat regional threats that traverse country boundaries [21] . Yet a number of geographic regions lack coordinated bat research networks, most notably Western Asia [4] , a region of 20 countries extending from Turkey in the west, Georgia in the north, Yemen in the south, and Afghanistan and Pakistan in the east. Furthermore, most bat research networks are not integrated with the zoonotic disease or viral research communities. Given the potential of Western Asia as an emerging zoonotic disease hotspot [22] , and bat-associated zoonoses hotspot in particular [9, 23] , surveillance initiatives focused on bat-associated viruses in Western Asia are warranted. In this review, we discuss the importance of collaboration between bat research networks and virus surveillance initiatives to understand the role of human activities in the transmission and spread of bat-associated viruses. We conduct a literature review to assess research effort on bats and bat-associated viruses around the world, and demonstrate that Western Asia constitutes a research gap, lacking an established bat research network and has limited published research on bats and their associated viruses. Lastly, we outline a new regional initiative to establish the first bat research network in Western Asia (i.e., the Western Asia Bat Research Network, WAB-Net), with the unique aim of taking an integrated approach to untangle host-virus dynamics to find \"win-win\" solutions that promote bat conservation and safeguard public and animal health across the region.",
