    "text": "Influenza phylogenies are odd, in some respects, consisting of one main trunk with many short and short-lived side branches [36, 39, 42, 43] . There are several factors that influence strain diversity, including the mutation rate, selection, drift, and crossimmunity-mediated competition between strains [39] . Feguson, et al. [39] felt that strain-transcending immunity was essential in restricting viral diversity. Ito, et al. [42] thought that the many side branches died out because they could not compete with the main-trunk lineage viruses. Others have noted the temporal extinction of circulating strains upon the introduction of new strains or serotypes [5] . Whatever the reason, a hierarchy of strain robustness is evident in the history of influenza viruses.",
