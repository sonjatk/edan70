    "text": "In the inflammatory response there is an increase of permeability of endothelial lining cells and influxes of blood leukocytes into the interstitium, oxidative burst, and release of cytokines [interleukins and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)]. At the same time, there is also an induction of the activity of several enzymes (oxygenases, nitric oxide synthases, peroxidases) as well as the arachidonic acid metabolism. In the inflammatory process there is also the expression of cellular adhesion molecules, such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) [22] .",
