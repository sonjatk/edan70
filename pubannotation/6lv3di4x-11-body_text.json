    "text": "activity of basolateral medium collected from JEV-infected NEC at 72 hpi (Fig. 6D ). We observed that medium from Laos strain-infected NEC induced a significant increase of porcine monocyte migration (Fig. 6D ). supernatants were collected and IL-8 levels were determined by ELISA. The experiment was repeated three times in duplicate. Data are shown as 25% to 75% interquartile boxes with means and 95% confidence intervals. Different superscript letters indicate significant difference (P Ͻ 0.05) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain (letters without and with apostrophe for JEV Laos and JEV Nakayama, respectively); differences between distinct JEV strains and the mock control at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks (*, P Յ 0.05; **, P Յ 0.002; ***, P Յ 0.001).",
