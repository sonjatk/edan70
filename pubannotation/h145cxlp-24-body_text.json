    "text": "Comparison of PICU patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 between the post-pandemic seasons showed that median age was 1.7 years in the third season and, thus, significantly lower than in the first season. A significant age shift towards younger children, from a median age of 5 to 3 years, had already been observed in a comparison of the pandemic and the first post-pandemic season in Germany [20] . The continued shift towards younger patients in the third season is likely to be due to increasing immunity in the older paediatric population, after previous contact with A(H1N1)pdm09. Seroprevalence data from Germany had already shown evidence for A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in as many as 25 % of children aged 1-4 years and 48 % of 5-17 year-old children for the pandemic season 2009/10 [26] . A similar shift towards younger hospitalized children [27, 28] and towards younger children with severe paediatric A(H1N1)pdm09-associated influenza from the pandemic season to the first post-pandemic season had also been detected in other European countries [28] [29] [30] [31] .",
