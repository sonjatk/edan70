    "text": "The reduction of macrophages in number might be due to the induction of apoptosis by vaccinia virus in vitro infection as previous reported [36] . To understand the mechanisms responsible for the reduction of the number of macrophage, we performed another experiment to confirm whether the macrophages were infected with vaccinia virus inoculation. However, based on PCR analyses; vaccinia virus DNA was not present in liver tissue that contained macrophages ( Figure S7 ). Furthermore, apoptosis of macrophages was not detected in liver samples (Data not shown). Based on these results, it is unlikely that the reduction in the number of macrophages was due to apoptosis induced by vaccinia virus infection. Although rVV-N25 reduced the number of macrophage, precise mechanism is still unknown. Further examination to elucidate the mechanism is required.",
