For instance, in the abstract, \"Based on measurements of the European Environment Agency (EEA),…\" and \"A framework for developing European health-based ventilation guidelines…\" would be preferable. I realise that English is not the authors' first language (and, again, I should stress that most of the language used is very good). However, I think the paper would benefit from a thorough edit by a native English speaker.",
