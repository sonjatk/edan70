    "text": "We have used the designed workflows for the phyloinformatics analysis of NA in different populations of H5N1 in particular and in influenza viruses in general. The reason for choosing a protein-based phyloinformatics approach instead of a gene-based approach is to gain a better understanding of the molecular evolution of the gene product that makes this deadly virus spreading across different hosts. To perform this study, three protein data sets have been collected as follows. ",
