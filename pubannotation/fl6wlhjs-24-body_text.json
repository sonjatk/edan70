    "text": "A common parametric approach that we follow in this study is to first obtain the residual process by subtracting off the non-stationary part of the model (i.e., the effect of the covariates). We then define the filter {c k,j }, that first decorrelates (whitens) this residual process using the onestep-ahead prediction errors and second filters this whitened series using {a l } to yield the detection process {D k,t }.",
