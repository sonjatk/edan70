    "text": "Western blot analysis. Cells were harvested and cellular proteins were extracted as mentioned above. Total cellular proteins from different time points were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk powder dissolved in tris-buffered saline, containing 0.05% Tween-20, for 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies (see below) were diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer and incubated with the membranes overnight at 4 Â°C. Next, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at 1:3000 for 2 h at room temperature. Detected proteins were revealed using the ECL Detection Kit (KeyGen Biotech).",
