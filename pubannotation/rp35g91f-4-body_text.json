    "text": "Analyses of the prevalence, length, and thickness of myocardial extensions has resulted in conflicting reports as to whether various parameters do (Hassink et al. 2003; Kholová and Kautzner 2003) or do not (Kholová and Kautzner 2004; Saito et al. 2000) correlate with atrial fibrillation. However, mutations in genes encoding the transcription factors Nkx2-5 (Huang et al. 2013; Xie et al. 2013) , Pitx2c (Qiu et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2014) , and GATA6 ) are all associated with atrial fibrillation; these genes are known to be required for cardiovascular development. These data suggest that perturbation of the transcriptional program associated with cardiac muscle (but not necessarily disrupting morphology) may underlie the association of the pulmonary myocardium with atrial fibrillation. Consistent with this, both PITX2C and NKX2-5 are required to direct and maintain the identity of the pulmonary myocardium (Mommersteeg et al. 2007) . Lost or reduced expression of NKX2-5 causes pulmonary myocardium cells to adopt a pacemaker-like phenotype similar to cells of the sinus horn myocardium, without altering cellular morphology (Mommersteeg et al. 2007; Ye et al. 2015) . This implies that healthy pulmonary myocardium could gain pacemaker function from which an ectopic beat might originate via a shift in the gene expression program away from that of working myocardium and toward a pacemaker program. Thus, molecular analysis of pulmonary myocardium cells in vivo is warranted and could provide a powerful tool for understanding the pathobiology of atrial fibrillation and identifying novel therapeutic targets. This led us to investigate gene regulatory mechanisms that might drive the expression of cardiac genes in this tissue.",
