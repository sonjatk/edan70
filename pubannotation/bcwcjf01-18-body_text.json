    "text": "Consensus sequence reconstruction in the genome coding regions N protein. Sequence data was obtained from amino acid 76 through the end of the N protein coding region. One amino acid substitution, F80L, differentiated the 2003-10 samples from the 1995-96 samples ( Table 2 ). The samples from 2000 also had an F at residue 80 but differed from the other Humboldt samples at residue 106 with D replaced by G. A subset of the 2009-10 samples from southernmost region of the outbreak area and collected early in the outbreak (foxes 5, 2, and 20) had an N to S substitution at site 119. P protein. Phylogenetic analysis grouped samples primarily according to date, with limited grouping according to geography. Only one amino acid change, R30K, differentiated the 2003-10 samples from 1995-96 samples ( Figure S3 ). This residue lies in a conserved region of the protein [21, 22] . The samples from 2000 differed from the 1995-96 at two sites, R86K and E156G, and from the outbreak samples at amino acid 30 with an R at this site rather than a K. Sequence data for the P protein was available for other CA skunk samples in GenBank including one from neighboring Trinity Co. collected in 1997 (V650 CASK); all had an R at site 30, thus the R30K change is unique to the 2003/10 outbreak. , the G open reading frame had low coverage due to difficulty obtaining PCR products for this region ( Figure S1 ). The primers for this project were designed prior to availability of genomic sequence for the CA skunk variant, thus making primer design especially problematic for variable regions of the genome. This likely impacts the number of subconsensus variants detected in this region.",
