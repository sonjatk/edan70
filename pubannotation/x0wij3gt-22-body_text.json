    "text": "In summary, our findings demonstrate that PGE 2 stimulates human bronchial epithelial cell proliferation through activations of EP4-related signal and c-Jun, which, in turn, increases activation and expression of PDK1. This suggests that PDK1 and c-Jun might play an important role in human bronchial epithelial cells thereby influencing their growth.",
