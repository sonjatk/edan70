    "text": "Five species within the genus Leishmania have been identified in cats: Leishmania mexicana, Leishmania venezuelensis, Leishmania braziliensis and Leishmania amazonensis in the New World, and Leishmania infantum in both the New and Old Worlds (Table 1) . We can therefore state that cats are likely to be infected by the same Leishmania species found in humans or other animals in the same geographic area.",
