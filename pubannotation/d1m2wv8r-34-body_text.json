    "text": "To identify the DEPs more comprehensively, we used two methods: An analysis of variance test that included a p-value < 0.05 and at least one of the fold-change ratios between any time points passing the threshold was used to identify the DEPs of all groups (Method 1). Furthermore, to clarify the protein alterations of each time points, a two-tailed unpaired t test that included a p-value < 0.05 and a fold-change ratio between a given time point and the mock (114) passing the threshold was used for screening the DEPs at the different time points (Method 2).",
