    "text": "Cats c05 and c06 were administered ODN 2216 once subcutaneously at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg body weight while cats c07 and c08 received endotoxin-free PBS as control. The treatments were distributed in equal portions bilaterally in axillary and inguinal regions. Heparinized blood was collected at time points 0 h (just before injection of the treatment), 8 h, 24 h, 48 h, 96 h and 192 h. The cats were clinically examined and body temperature was measured at each time point. Whole blood samples were used in part for the assessment of hematological paramaters with the Sysmex XT 2000iV (Sysmex, Norderstedt, Germany) as previously described [57] . The rest of the blood was mixed with mRNA lysis buffer (Roche Diagnostics) immediately upon blood collection and processed as recommended by the manufacturer. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation of whole blood samples for 10 min at 1500 × g and conserved at −80°C until use for in vitro experiments. Mx mRNA expression was measured by qPCR and normalized to the expression of two feline housekeeping genes as described above. The expression factors depicted in the figures represent the ratio of mRNA levels from a specific time point to mRNA levels from time point 0 h. For viral inhibition assays, the plasma collected from each cat at each time point was incubated for 24 h with fcwf-4 cells prior to their inoculation with FCV. The assays were carried out as described above and viral inhibition factors were calculated as follows:",
