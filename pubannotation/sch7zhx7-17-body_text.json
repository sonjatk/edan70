    "text": "Our previous work demonstrating that CVB3 was sensitive to polyamine depletion via DFMO suggested a role for polyamines in virus replication [25] . To ascertain how CVB3 evolves in response to repeated replication cycles in the absence of polyamine depletion, we passaged the virus in the presence of DFMO. We treated Vero-E6 cells with 500 µM DFMO or left controls untreated (NT), for four days prior to infection with CVB3 at MOI 0.1 plaque forming units (pfu)/mL. After 24 h, we collected cellular supernatant and passaged 1/10th of the volume onto naïve cells. Viral titers were determined intermittently ( Figure 1A ) and at passage five, the passaged virus was exposed to increasing doses of DFMO, from 10 µM to 5 mM, and titers measured by plaque assay after 24 h of infection. We observed that virus that had been passaged but not exposed to DFMO remained susceptible, with significant decreases in viral titer observed at DFMO concentrations above 100 µM and an IC50 value of 70.9 µM. In contrast, virus passaged in DFMO exhibited significant resistance to DFMO treatment, with an IC50 value of 293 µM, suggesting developing resistance to DFMO.",
