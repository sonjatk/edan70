    "text": "We also compared Iterative HFold with IPknot [42] . While IPknot is faster than Iterative HFold and uses less memory, we found that for the HK-PK and IP-pk168 data sets, Iterative HFold provides significantly more accurate predictions of pseudoknotted structures, compared with IPknot. Based on our results on the HK-PK data set, Iterative HFold's performance with more than 5% information about the true pseudoknot-free structure, is better than that of IPknot with default settings (data shown in Additional file 3). We note that Sato et al. [42] find the performance of IPknot with predictions using \"NUPACK\" superior to all versions of IPknot, but since this model can be used for RNA sequences of length < 80 nucleotides, we did not compare our results with this version of IPknot. Among all different versions of IPknot we tested, we found all but γ 1 = 1 and γ 2 = 1 setting producing similar confidence intervals for all but the HK-PK-free data sets, for which γ 1 = 4 and γ 2 = 8 produces the best result (data shown in Additional file 2). While running parameter refinement with one iteration improved the confidence intervals in the HK-PK data set, it did not result in any improvement in accuracy in the rest of our data sets as in many cases IPknot failed to produce results. We note that our results on the IP-pk168 data set with different weight parameters perfectly match the results of Sato et al. [42] .",
