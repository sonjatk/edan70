    "text": "This assay is convenient for evaluating the effects of antioxidants against slow oxidation phenomena occurring over prolonged periods of time, as shown in the shelf life of foods [59] . The authors [43] using this method showed that the oils of Thymus vulgaris, Eugenia caryophyllus, Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume., Ocimum basilicum L. and Illicium verum Hook. f. were able to prevent the oxidation of hexanal to hexanoic acid promoted by heat and pure air introduced in a sealed system, after 40 days of storage. The decrease of hexanal was followed by gas chromatography coupled to a flame ionisation detector. Such results may demonstrate the low importance of phenolic compounds to prevent hexanal oxidation, since Illicium verum oil was mainly cosnstituted by anethole [43] .",
