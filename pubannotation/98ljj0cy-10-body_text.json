    "text": "Similar to MERS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus began causing sporadic self-limited outbreaks in late 2002, after which it seemingly developed sustained human-to-human transmission, and spread internationally. 12 Post-epidemic studies of SARS have revealed a lowlevel circulation of the virus several months before it was first detected in humans in Guangdong Province of China, suggesting a period of time in which the virus adapted to human hosts. 13 While it is difficult to draw direct comparisons, it seems possible that MERS-CoV is demonstrating a similar transmission pattern, reflected by the sporadic outbreaks occurring in 2012, followed by sustained low-level transmission in 2013, and now showing a larger human infection KSA wave in 2014 ( Figure 1 ). 4 If the epidemiologic model of SARS is relevant to MERS, 13 this current progression in MERS-CoV ecology may presage much greater future MERS-CoV epidemics.",
