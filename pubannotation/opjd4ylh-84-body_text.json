    "text": "The study focused on the experience of nurses caring for TB patients at Tshilidzini Hospital in Limpopo Province, South Africa and therefore the findings cannot be generalized. However, according to Smith [33] , generalizability in a qualitative study is not intended. The hospital where the study was conducted is situated in the rural area. Therefore, if other hospitals had been included, it could have led to different data findings.",
