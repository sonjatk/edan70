    "text": "Mouse experiments were approved by the University of Western Australia's Animal Ethics Committee. Four $8-wk-old male BALB/c mice were killed with an overdose of pentobarbitone (160 mg/kg via intraperitoneal injection) and fixed by cardiac perfusion with heparinized phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (15 IU/ml; heparin) followed by fixative (2% paraformaldehyde with 0.2% picric acid in PBS, pH 7.4). Heart and lungs were excised and postfixed for 48 hr at 4Â°in the same fixative. Tissue was washed, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin wax. Five-micrometerthick sections through lungs or ventricular myocardium (control) were cut and mounted onto Superfrost Plus microscope slides (Sigma-Aldrich).",
