    "text": "To provide some sensitivity analysis to estimate the effectiveness of source control, two other scenarios with lower and higher source control capabilities were also analysed. In the lower source control scenario (scenario 3.1) it was assumed a reduction of 80% for radon, CO and SHS and 25% reduction of PM 2.5 , VOC and dampness exposures. In the higher source control scenario (scenario 3.2) a total control (100%) of radon, CO and SHS and 75% reduction of PM 2.5 , VOC and dampness exposures were assumed.",
