    "text": "Our expression analysis of by BAL recovered AMs from lungs 3, 6 and 12 h after CNP treatment, clearly contradict with the concept of AMs as the cellular inflammation trigger. In fact, AMs from CNP instilled mice showed in comparison to sham exposed or untreated controls, no sign of inflammatory activation. The expression of the major transcriptional markers for classical (M1) macrophage activation, Nos2 and Tnf showed no exposure related change, neither 3, nor 6, or 12 h after CNP treatment, nor was any other of the proinflammatory genes investigated such as Il1b, Cxcl1,-2,-5 or Nfkbia,-b, and -z, induced by the CNP treatment. Notwithstanding, all these M1 marker genes exhibited a significant induction within 12 h after a moderate endotoxin stimulation (Fig. 5) . Other activation markers such Il6 or Ccl2 and also the most prominent factor Arg1 for alternative (M2) activation remained unchanged in AMs 12 h after CNP treatment.",
