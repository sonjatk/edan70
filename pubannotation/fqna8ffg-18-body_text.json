    "text": "The inflammatory response is governed by a series of well-orchestrated intracellular and extracellular signaling events that control the expression and release of immune mediators, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [45] . One of the most important parameter and characteristics of acute inflammation is the migration of leukocytes to the site of injury. Particularly the accumulation of neutrophil granulocytes represents an essential defense strategy of the innate immune system and is recognized as the hallmark of acute inflammation [46] . The aim of the present study was to gain insight into the initiation of inflammation trigged by the inhalation of low-solubility and low-toxicity particles such as carbonaceous nanoparticles; more particularly we ask the question which cell type in the periphery of the lung may be the first activated and thus initiate the inflammatory response upon pulmonary particle deposition. In particular we raised the hypothesis that alveolar macrophages, the major phagocytes of the alveolus, get rapidly activated upon particle uptake and as consequence stimulated to express inflammatory mediators to kick-start the local inflammatory immune response.",
