    "text": "Ubiquitination is a widely used posttranslational modification that has emerged as a key regulator of synapse development and function (DiAntonio and Hicke, 2004; Mabb and Ehlers, 2010) . Ubiquitination of a growing list of pre-and postsynaptic proteins can regulate their stability, function and subcellular localization (Mabb and Ehlers, 2010; Bingol and Sheng, 2011; Kowalski and Juo, 2012) . The covalent attachment of ubiquitin to lysine residues on target proteins is catalyzed by a sequence of enzymatic reactions mediated by E1 ubiquitin-activating enzymes, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and E3 ubiquitin ligases (Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998) . Ubiquitin itself has seven lysine residues and a primary amine at its N-terminus that can be utilized to form ubiquitin chains. Monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination, using various chain-linkage types, create distinct structural topologies that are recognized by ubiquitin binding proteins that mediate the various functions of ubiquitin. For example, Lys48-and Lys11-linked polyubiquitination result in proteasomal degradation, whereas Lys63-linked polyubiquitination is typically associated with signaling and endo-lysosomal trafficking (Piper and Lehner, 2011; Clague et al., 2012; Nathan et al., 2013) . Ubiquitin can be removed from substrates by proteases called deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). The human genome encodes approximately 100 DUBs that are categorized into six families. The ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) make up the largest family, comprised of 54 cysteine proteases (Nijman et al., 2005; Mevissen and Komander, 2017) .",
