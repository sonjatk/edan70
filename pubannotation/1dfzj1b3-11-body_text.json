    "text": "In direct methods, they can be based on the kinetic of lipid peroxidation or on the kinetic of nonchain process (direct competition methods). In the first case, two modes of lipid peroxidation can be used for testing the antioxidant activity: one of them is the autoxidation mode when the process is progressing spontaneously, with self-acceleration due to the accumulation of LOOH; the other mode is based on the use of the kinetic model of the controlled chain reaction. The utilization of thermo-labile azo-compounds [water-soluble 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) and lipidsoluble 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) (AMVN)] that decompose and produce active free radicals at moderate temperatures at any desired rate, which can be easily altered and controlled are two good examples greatly used [29] . When these thermo-labile azo-compounds are not used, and for accelerating lipid oxidation, increased partial oxygen pressure and temperature; addition of transition metal catalysts; exposure to light; and variable shaking and free radical sources may be used [5] .",
