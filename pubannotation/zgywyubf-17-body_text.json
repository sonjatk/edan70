    "text": "Next, the effect of ORF2 protein on the expression of two TPA inducible cytokines-IL-6 and IL-8 was measured by performing real time quantitative RT-PCR of these cytokine transcripts in ORF2 expressing Huh7 cells, which were treated with TPA for 6 hours prior to RNA isolation. As expected, IL-6 and IL-8 transcript level was decreased in ORF2 expressing TPA treated cells in comparison to mock transfcetd TPA treated cells ( Figure 5D) . These experiments indicates that ORF2 protein, by virtue of its ability to inhibit NF-ÎºB activity, suppress TPA induced IL-6 and IL-8 RNA synthesis.",
