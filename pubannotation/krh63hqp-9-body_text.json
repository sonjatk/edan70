    "text": "While phylogenetic studies can build robust family trees, they do so by focusing only on a limited number of \"informative\" genomic locations [44] . Even though the influenza genome is broken into eight separate RNAs, unless an individual is infected with two strains simultaneously (providing an opportunity for reassortment), all eight sections are inherited as a set in a form of linkage [36] . Thus, neutral and slightly deleterious mutations are carried along with those mutations under positive or purifying selection. This gives us enough information to make many phylogenetic inferences, and we have a wealth of data telling us the history of the various viral lines, but these phylogenetic techniques ignore genetic change within a larger portion of the genome in order to focus on the phylogenetically-informative sites. There is abundant evidence for multiple substitutions in specific places that are, in turn, sites of active selection [42] , but what about the rest of the genome? Fitch, et al. [36] noted that the main strategy of influenza viruses was to outrun the immune system of the host by maintaining a high mutation rate. They wondered \"why such a virus does not accumulate so many deleterious mutations as to die of its own ineptitude.\" They further wondered if the only reason influenza viruses continued to circulate in mammalian species was because of a sort of \"gene therapy\" through reassortment with stronger, less mutated avian viruses.",
