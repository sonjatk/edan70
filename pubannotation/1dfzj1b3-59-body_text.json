    "text": "When a Fe 3+ -TPTZ (2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine) complex is reduced to the Fe 2+ form by an antioxidant under acidic conditions, an intense blue color develops with an absorption maximum at 593 nm. The antioxidant effect (reducing ability) can be evaluated by monitoring the formation of a Fe 2+ -TPTZ complex with a spectrophotometer [59] .",
