    "text": "We found that excluding data based on the following criteria significantly reduced the effect of background interference that can result from Fourier analysis: (1) the amplitude of the peak must be greater than three times the amplitude of the background (defined as the maximum peak of the first three FFT Mag), (2) the CBF must be within a clinically relevant range (for example between 3 to 20 Hz for respiratory cilia and 3 to 60 Hz for brain ependymal cilia). Data that does not support these criteria was defined as 0 Hz.",
