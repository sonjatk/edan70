    "text": "The model presented in this paper uses a weighted static network to simulate the risk of transmission between livestock farms. Weighted static networks are regularly used in livestock disease models, and previous work indicates that they provide good prediction of mean epidemic sizes, though may potentially underestimate variability when compared with results on dynamic networks [38] . The advantage with a weighted static network approach is that it is possible to determine the epidemic impact independent of time of year. However, there is clear seasonality observed in the cattle movement network [49] , and it is therefore possible that a weighted static network could result in an under-or over-prediction of epidemic size. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that the preferred sampling strategies are robust, although the proportion of nodes that need to be sampled may vary dependent upon time of year. Future studies will focus upon constructing rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc. R. Soc. B 282: 20150205 a dynamic network, and testing network sampling schemes and temporal sampling schemes (whereby sampling is targeted based on time of year) on their ability to predict epidemic behaviour.",
