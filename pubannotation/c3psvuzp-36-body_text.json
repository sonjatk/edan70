(DOC) 1 The largest exon of indicated PARP4 genes (corresponding to human exon 30) were aligned and subjected to analysis by Kestimator. 2 Estimated Ka and Ks values as determined by Kestimator. 95% confidence interval values are shown in italics. 3 The dN/dS ratio as determined by dividing the estimated Ka value by the estimated Ks value. 4 Percent confidence that the observed dN/dS ratio is .1 (indicative of the region evolving under positive selection) as calculated by K-estimator.
