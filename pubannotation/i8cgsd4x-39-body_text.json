    "text": "Three to five day-old female mosquitoes (n = 40) were microinjected with dsRNA against CxCul4 or GFP (200 ng/mosquito). Mosquitoes were blood-fed with WNV (1.13×10^6 pfu/ ml) one day later and were maintained in a diurnal cycle (23/26°C) in an environmental cabinet. At 10-12 days post-infection, saliva was collected in capillary tubes containing 5 μl FCS for 10 min using a protocol described previously [61] . Midguts were dissected and homogenized using a bead-beater. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit from the midgut and carcass of individual mosquitoes and was used for real-time RTqPCR as described above. Saliva from each mosquito was diluted in 300 μl of L-15 medium and was used to determine viral titer by plaque assay as described above.",
