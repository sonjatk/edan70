    "text": "Among seven Himalayan Lauraceae species, only the essential oils of Dodecadenia grandiflora and Lindera pulcherrima were able to inhibit lipid peroxidation, using liver homogenate as lipidic substrate. These oils, along with Persea gamblei, were already reported as being potent inhibitors of linoleic oxidation measured through the Î²-carotene bleaching test [44] . Such activities were independent of the presence of phenolic compounds in the essential oils.",
