    "text": "The partial hexon gene sequences have been deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers KM377987-KM378038 and KM877524-KM877547. A total of 28 prototype reference sequences of HAdV used for comparisons with sequences from this study were obtained from GenBank (S1 Table) . These were aligned and manually adjusted using Clustal X2 and BioEdit. The phylogenetic tree was drawn based on the hexon region of adenovirus by the neighbourjoining (NJ) method using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version 5.0.",
