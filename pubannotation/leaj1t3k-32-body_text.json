    "text": "Due to its ability to interact with cellular and viral proteins, p27SJ, a protein from the St John's wort, has been put forward as a potential anti-HIV-1 molecule by Darbinian et a l. [104] . Recently, the investigators have used the tat peptide as part of a bi-directional protein transduction system where the antiviral protein of interest, p27SJ, was expressed with tat at its C-terminal. Secreted into the cell medium, the fusion protein efficiently entered HIV-infected cells through a tat-mediated uptake and strongly inhibited HIV-1 transcription and replication (Figure 1) .",
