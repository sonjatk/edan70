    "text": "There are two very popular methods for monitoring lipid peroxidation: determination of conjugated dienes (absorbance at 234 nm) and the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) assay. This method measures the malonaldehyde formed after lipid hydroperoxide decomposition, which forms a pink chromophore with thiobarbituric acid (TBA). However, TBARS is representative of a rather late stage of lipid oxidation, when the oxidation substrate has undergone substantial transformation [29] . There are other methods, including the determination of peroxide value, iodine value, chromatographic measurement of volatile compounds, formic acid measurement [the Rancimat method in an automated test that measures the conductivity of low molecular weight fatty acids (formic acid) produced during the auto-oxidation of lipids at 100 ÂºC or above] [5] .",
