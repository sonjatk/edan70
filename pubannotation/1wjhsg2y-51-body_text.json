    "text": "It is also important to point out that to achieve an optimal balance between bat conservation and disease surveillance, it is critical that research findings are reported in a manner that avoids fear-mongering statements and promotes the ecological and economic benefits of protecting local bat populations. If reporting is done improperly and in haste, consequences include the destruction of roosting sites or culling bat populations, which can undermine conservation efforts and can break down trust among network participants. Similarly, accurate and timely reporting of virus surveillance in bats should be coupled with scientifically-informed intervention recommendations to reduce bat-human interactions (e.g., placing bamboo skirts over date palm sap collection pots curtailed the spread of Nipah virus in Bangladesh [153] ). Successfully blending both conservation and public health messaging is difficult, but critical to preventing spillover into human populations and the subsequent retaliatory actions against bats [10, 12, 154] .",
