    "text": "Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE [56] and subsequently transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). Membranes were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody (Ab). Gag was detected by a rabbit Ab recognizing CA (Seramun, Heidesee, Germany). The anti-Î²-actin antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The anti-mouse and anti-rabbit Viruses 2017, 9, 222 5 of 22 secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were obtained from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). HA-tagged ubiquitin was visualized using an HA-reactive monoclonal antibody (mAb) directly conjugated to HRP (Roche).",
