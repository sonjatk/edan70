    "text": "The narratives on attribution of responsibility for managing the SARs outbreak is most prevalent in the literature, with the limited capacity of the Canadian Health Care System to prepare for and respond to an emerging infectious disease as a main narrative. Many scholars pointed to flaws in the funding and organization of Canada's health care system-federally, provincially, and municipally-to explain the SARS outbreak in Toronto. Some argued that information was communicated inefficiently and was often incorrect (Silas et al. 2006) . Personal protective equipment was in short supply (Summers 2009) , and the use of occupational health and safety in Toronto's hospital system was inefficient, leading to further spread (Silas et al. 2006 ). Toronto's hospital system was also blamed for lacking admission policies and public laboratories (Wong et al. 2007) : an inability to supply health services when demand suddenly increased and a lack of quality leadership (Arya et al. 2009 ). Toronto was also ill-prepared to address the unique vulnerability of the homeless to SARS (Leung et al. 2008) .",
