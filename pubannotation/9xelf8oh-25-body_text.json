    "text": "SQPV infections were generally localised to cutaneous areas in grey squirrels (Fig. 2a, b) . Arm swabs gave the highest RQ (ratio of target (SQPV) to control gene (PGK)) (mean RQ = 0.18 ± 0.14 CI, n = 12) and the greatest proportion of positive results in infected grey squirrels (0.83 (10/12), 0.51-0.97 CI). Eyelid swabs also showed a relatively high RQ of SQPV DNA (mean RQ = 0.029 ± 0.027 CI, n = 12), although it appears the area is less frequently infected, with the proportion of positive results from eyelid swabs being lower (0.58 (7/12), 0.29-0.84 CI) than on the arm. Flank skin samples appeared to be commonly infected with the virus in infected individuals (0.75 (9/12), 0.43-0.93 CI) but with a low intensity of infection (RQ mean = 0.004 ± 0.007 CI, n = 12). Non-cutaneous samples showed low incidence and intensity of SQPV infection, with blood, stomach and skeletal muscle showing the highest prevalence of the virus in positive animals all ca. 0.3 (Fig. 2b) .",
