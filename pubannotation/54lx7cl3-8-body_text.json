    "text": "Numerous epidemiologic studies describe synergistic and antagonistic relationships among various commensal bacteria [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] and, although the exact biological mechanisms remain unclear, in vivo and in vitro experiments suggest potential mechanisms involve either direct interaction between bacterial species or indirect interactions via the host immune system (Table 1) . A number of population studies suggest that S. pneumoniae carriage is positively associated with H. influenzae [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] and Moraxella catarrhalis [18, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] carriage but negatively associated with S. aureus [19, 20, [24] [25] [26] [27] [29] [30] [31] [32] . Furthermore, S. aureus carriage is generally negatively associated with H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis [19, 24, 31] carriage, whereas H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis are believed to be positively associated [18, 22, 24, 33] . Nevertheless, our understanding is limited, as the dynamics of niche competition likely consist of complex relationships between multiple species [31, 34] and strains [15, 35] , further influenced by host and environmental factors [22, 36] . As carriage is an important precursor of respiratory infections for certain bacterial species [12] , unraveling the complex system of bacterial interactions that determine URT microbiota may be key factor for understanding the etiology of pneumonia.",
