    "text": "We next performed inhibition experiments in Huh-7 cells and staining for dsRNAs, which are intermediates in viral replication. dsRNA was detected only in infected cells treated with DMSO and not in any of the inhibitor-treated cells or mock-infected cells. (Fig. 4a) . Furthermore, we measured the levels of negative-strand RNA intermediates at 24 h p.i. from DENV-infected cells that were treated with the inhibitors. N-Desmethylclozapine-treated cells showed a Ͼ75% reduction in negative-strand RNA levels, while both salmeterol-and fluoxetine-treated cells had Ͻ10% of the negative-strand RNA of DMSO-treated cells (Fig. 4b) . These results demonstrate that all three inhibitors act at very early stages of dengue virus RNA replication.",
