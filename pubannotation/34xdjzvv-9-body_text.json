    "text": "To examine the viral load of EV71 in the tissues of mice while treated with N3, we isolated RNA from the different organs from 5746-infected mice on Day 6 post infection and then quantified EV71 transcripts using real-time RT-PCR. We noticed that administration of N3 reduced viral expression significantly in the brain, spinal cord, muscle, skin, and the intestine (Fig. 6 ). We also confirmed that CNS-and limb muscle-tropism of EV71 viremia occurred in this model [11] .",
