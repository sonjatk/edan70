    "text": "The reduction in eIF4G cleavage by viral protease in the presence of polyamine depleting molecules could be the result of polyamines modulating viral protease activity, or the phenotype could be due to restriction of virus replication, protease translation, and subsequent reduction in proteolytic activity. To directly measure viral protease activity in cells, we generated a protease-sensitive dual luciferase reporter system. In this split luciferase system, cleavage of a target sequence allows for robust firefly luciferase activity, which can be normalized to a renilla luciferase transfection control. This system has previously been used to explore the activity of viral polymerases [34] [35] [36] , though it has not been considered in the context of polyamine depletion. To generate this system, we cloned a 2A target sequence-MTNTGAFG-and a 3C target sequence-AMEQG-into the firefly luciferase reporter [37] . We also cloned 2A and 3C into the pCMV plasmid to drive robust protease expression. These constructs were cotransfected into 293T cells either left untreated or treated with increasing doses of DFMO. Firefly activity was measured 24 h later and normalized to renilla activity. We observed that for both 2A ( Figure 4C ) and 3C ( Figure 4D ), protease activity was significantly reduced with DFMO treatment, to levels that were nearly undetectable with DFMO concentrations at or above 500 ÂµM. These data support our hypothesis that polyamines modulate viral protease activity, and polyamine depletion restricts virus replication by quelling viral protease activity.",
