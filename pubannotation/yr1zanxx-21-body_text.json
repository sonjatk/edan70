    "text": "Microglia are hypothesized to act as immediate responders to CNS pathogens as resident APCs that coordinate intra-parenchymal adaptive immune response [54] . Previous studies indicated that clearance of WNV in the CNS requires antiviral CD8 + T cells [19, 32, 55] , and that microglia, astrocytes, and neurons express chemokines that attract mononuclear cells to the CNS [21, 56, 57] . To determine the impact of CSF1R antagonism on recruitment of these cells to the CNS, leukocytes isolated from the cortices of WNV-NS5-E218A-infected (See figure on previous page.) Fig. 3 CSF1R antagonism increases mortality and CNS viral burdens during i.c. infection with WNV-NS5-E218A. Mice were fed chow containing PLX5622 or control chow for 2 weeks, infected i.c. with WNV-NS5-E218A at 10 4 PFU, then monitored for a mortality and b weight loss for up to 25 dpi. a Survival curves show a significant increase in mortality in mice treated with PLX5622 compared with control as calculated by log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. b Weight was measured daily during acute illness as a measure of illness. After death, the last measured weight was carried through to the end of the experiment. Significantly greater weight loss was measured in PLX5622-treated mice compared with controls as calculated by two-way ANOVA with matched values comparing group means without multiple comparisons. For a and b, data represent the compilation of two independent experiments with 10 mice per group. c At 8 dpi, cortical brain tissue was extracted and relative transcript levels in tissue homogenates were measured by SYBR qRT-PCR for indicated cytokines. Data for individual mice were normalized to Gapdh. Data are presented as mean ± SEM of three to five mice from one experiment. Statistical significance between treatment groups for each cytokine was calculated by t test. d-j Tissue viral loads were measured by plaque assay at 2, 4, 6, and 8 dpi in control (black) or PLX5622-treated (red) mice. k Serum viral loads as measured by qRT-PCR. d-k Data are presented as scatter plots with each mouse represented by a dot with the mean indicated by a line. For d-k, data represent the compilation of two-independent experiments with 10 mice per group. Dotted lines in d-k indicate assay limit of detection. l-o Representative confocal microscopic images of Tunel (red), NeuN (green), and DAPI (blue) of hippocampus (l, m) and cerebellum (n, o) of control-(l, n) or PLX5622-treated (m, o) mice infected i.c. with WNV-NS5-E218A at 6 dpi. Arrow heads point to DAPI-positive nuclei positive for both Tunel and NeuN. Asterisks denote DAPI-and Tunel-positive but NeuN-negative nuclei. p Quantification of confocal microscopic images for number of DAPI-positive nuclei positive for Tunel and NeuN in the hippocampus (Hpc), cerebellum (Cb), and brainstem (Bs). The number of Tunel+ NeuN+ nuclei per high-power field (HPF) was quantified from three to six images captured at × 40 per brain region across two separate brain sections for each of five independent mice collected in one experiment. Each symbol represents the average number for an individual mouse, with bar indicating mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was calculated using two-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparisons test. For all data: ns, not significant at P < 0.05; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ****P < 0.0001 mice were assessed by flow cytometry at 8 dpi. As expected, CD45 lo CD11b + (P1) population, which is primarily microglia [58] , remained significantly depleted in the PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice (Fig. 6a-c) . The population of CD45 hi CD11b + (P2), which is primarily infiltrating monocytes/macrophages [58] , were non-significantly reduced in the PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice. However, the number of CD45 hi CD11b neg (P3) lymphocyte population [58] were non-significantly elevated in PLX5622-treated compared with control mice, though the percentage of this population was significantly elevated (Fig. 6a-c) . This increase was largely due to elevated numbers of CD8 + T cell infiltration in PLX5622-treated mice (Fig. 6d-f ). Though there was no significant difference in the percentage of CD8 + T cells specific for the WNV immunodominant peptide between PLX5622 and control-treated mice, there were significantly more WNV-specific CD8 + T cells isolated from PLX5622 compared with control-treated cortex ( Fig. 6g-i) . Despite the increased infiltration of WNV-specific CD8 + T cells in PLX5622-treated mice, the percentages of cells expressing early activation marker CD69 and their level of expression were significantly reduced in PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice ( Fig. 6j-m) . Additionally, the percentage of WNV-specific CD8 + T cells positive for CD160 as well as the level of CD160 expression, which is specifically expressed on highly activated CD8 + T cells [59] , were reduced in PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice. However, the numbers of NS4B+CD8+ cells positive for either CD69 or CD160 were non-significantly elevated in PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated cortices (Fig. 6l, p) due to the increased numbers of NS4B +CD8+ cells. Because numbers of infiltrating WNV-specific CD8 + T cells derived from the CNS of PLX5622-treated animals were increased, we hypothesized that their lack of local reactivation may be the result of loss of co-stimulatory signals and/or inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 3c) in the CNS. In order to distinguish resident microglia from infiltrating monocytes/macrophages, CNS myeloid cells were examined for expression of the microglia-specific marker P2RY12 (Fig. 7a) . Infiltrating monocytes/ macrophages were then identified via gating of P2RY12 neg CD11b + cells (Fig. 7b) . Populations of both CNS-derived P2RY12 + CD45 + microglia (P1, Fig. 7a ) and CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + monocytes/macrophages (P2, Fig. 7b ) were reduced in PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice (Fig. 7i, j) . While no differences in the overall number of cells expressing MHCII were observed in P2RY12 + CD45 + , a significant reduction of MHCII + CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + was seen (Fig. 7c, d,  l) . This corresponded with a relative increase in the percentage of MHCII + cells in both P2RY12 + CD45 + and CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + populations due to the decreased numbers of total P2RY12 + CD45 + and CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + cells in the cortices of PLX5622-treated mice compared with control-treated mice (Fig. 7k) . However, the numbers of P2RY12 + CD45 + cells expressing B7 co-stimulatory signals CD80 and CD86 were significantly reduced in the CNS of PLX5622-treated mice compared with control-treated animals ( Fig. 7e-h, m-p) . The percentage of remaining P2RY12 + CD45 + cells expressing CD80 or CD86 were not reduced (Fig. 7m, o) ; however, the percentage of remaining CD11b + P2RY12 neg CD45 + cells expressing CD86 was significantly reduced (Fig. 7o) , similar to results seen in peripheral APCs (Figs. 4, 5) Together, these data suggest that resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages are important sources of CD80 and CD86 in the CNS, and PLX5622 treatment depletes these cellular sources of co-stimulatory molecules.",
