    "text": "Rhinovirus was detected in almost 25% of pneumonia cases of our series, but the detection rate was not different between cases and controls. However, this observation does formally excludes that rhinovirus could play a role in the etiology of pneumonia. Jain et al. recently observed that rhinovirus was detected in 27% of U.S. children with community-pneumonia requiring hospitalization [27]; this large study had however no control group, it was also not possible to estimate the prevalence of respiratory detection in children without pneumonia. Growing evidence suggests the role of rhinovirus in the etiology of viral pneumonia [28] or related to the risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia [29] . Other viruses, such as bocavirus or adenovirus were also equally prevalent in cases and controls. Again, this finding does not exclude completely their implication in pneumonia etiology in children from Mali. However these viruses were poorly described as causative agents of pneumonia in children from other sub-Saharan African countries.",
