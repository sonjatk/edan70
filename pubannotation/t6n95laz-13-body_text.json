    "text": "In the present study, 16 unique proteins were identified in patients with CHB and those with HBV-induced ACLF that had â‰¥1.5-fold differences in expression compared with those in the healthy controls. Those proteins belonged to six different categories based on protein function, while two out of the five proteins that were analyzed using western blotting were not classified according to biological processes (apolipoprotein J precursor and platelet factor 4 precursor). The biological functions of the remaining proteins in HBV infection and progression that were analyzed have not yet been elucidated; however, a number of theories are discussed in the following section.",
