    "text": "JEV replicates in porcine nasal mucosa explants. As a first step, we challenged porcine nasal mucosa explants from four different pig donors with both JEV genotype 1 strain Laos and genotype 3 strain Nakayama, in comparison to mock control (Fig. 1) . After 48 h postinfection (hpi), JEV envelope (E) protein was detected in epithelial cells ( Fig. 1A and B) , with a more efficient infection found with the Laos strain-challenged tissues. An increase in JEV RNA loads from both strains was also detected in porcine nasal mucosa, indicative of virus replication (Fig. 1C ). JEV Laos RNA showed an increase in expression from 24 hpi on, further increasing at 48 hpi. The Nakayama strain displayed a slower viral RNA increase, with only three out of four positive samples 48 hpi (Fig. 1C) .",
