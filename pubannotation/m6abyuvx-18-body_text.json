    "text": "To determine whether rVV-N25 treatment affected inflammatory cytokine production, we measured serum levels of inflammatory cytokines after rVV immunization. The serum levels of these inflammatory cytokines increased in the CN2-29 (+/2) / MxCre (+/2) mice ( Figure 6A, Figure S5 ). Immunization with rVV-N25 affected serum levels of inflammatory cytokines in CN2-29 (+/ 2) /MxCre (+/2) mice and caused a return to the cytokine levels observed in wild-type untreated mice ( Figure 6A ). In wild-type mice, the cytokine levels remained unchanged after immunization ( Figure 6A ). These results indicated that inflammatory cytokines were responsible for liver pathogenesis in the transgenic mice.",
