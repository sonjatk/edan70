    "text": "Eugenia caryophyllus (clove) showed the highest ferric reducing capacity in terms of Trolox Â® concentrations, such as in the DPPH method, in contrast to the TBARS method, in which Thymus vulgaris showed to be more effective [52] . According to the same authors, a significant linear correlation between FRAP values and total phenolic contents of the essential oils analysed were observed, except for the Thymus vulgaris essential oil.",
