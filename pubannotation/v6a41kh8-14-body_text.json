    "text": "The specimens were refrigerated at 2 to 8°C following collection at the field clinic and transported on ice every working day to the main laboratory in Kathmandu, where they were vortexed and divided into three equal aliquots in sterile vials (CryoTubes™, Nunc AS, Roskilde, Denmark). The aliquots analyzed in Nepal were either frozen at -70°C or kept at 2 to 8°C in the refrigerator before analysis. A separate comparative study verified that there were no substantial differences in proportion detected between the two alternative storage temperatures for up to three months (unpublished data). One aliquot was immediately frozen at -70°C and transported to Norway on dry ice and again stored at -70°C in case there should be a need for reanalysis.",
