    "text": "The rapid systemic appearance of CD69 expression suggested that a soluble factor such as IFNa, a known early responder to viral infections [22] and strong trigger of CD69 expression [17, 19, 20] , was inducing the response. To determine whether the LDV-induced IFNa response [16] could be responsible for CD69 induction, we first utilized the fact that IFNa induces CD69 expression on B cells in vitro [19] . Splenic B cells were isolated from na√Øve mice using CD19+ magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec) and cultured with 10% plasma taken from mice infected 16 hours earlier with LDV. B cells cultured for 4 hours with plasma from infected, but not uninfected mice, significantly upregulated CD69 expression ( Figure 2 ). Furthermore, upregulation of CD69 expression was prevented by addition of a neutralizing antibody specific for IFNa (PBL Interferon Source) in a concentrationdependent manner. These findings suggested that the IFNa response to LDV infection might be responsible for the partial activation of lymphocytes in vivo as well.",
