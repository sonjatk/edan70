    "text": "Porcine macrophages preparation and infection. MDM were generated from monocytes as previously described (70) . To this end, blood from 6-to 24-month-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Swiss Large White pigs from our own breeding facilities was taken, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated using density centrifugation (1.077 g/liter; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Then monocytes were isolated by magnetic cell sorting with an LS column (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) as CD172a ϩ cells using monoclonal antibody (MAb) clone 74-22-15 (ATCC). Sorted monocytes were seeded at 5 ϫ 10 5 /ml in DMEM-10% FBS and porcine macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; 20 U/ml, produced in-house [70, 71] ) and cultured for 3 days at 39°C and 5% CO 2 . After MDM differentiation, medium was replaced with fresh MDM (for nonpolarized MDM) or with medium supplemented with IL-4 (100 U/ml, produced in-house; for IL-4-polarized MDM) (72, 73) and incubated for another 24 h.",
