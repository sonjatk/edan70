    "text": "A promising addition to vaccination is the manipulation of innate immunity. Innate pathogen recognition relies on a set of sensory molecules, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which enable the immediate reaction of specific immune cells to pathogen \"danger signals\", the so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [4] . Due to their abundance in all bacterial as well as some viral genomes, oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanosine (CpG) motifs are effectively recognized as PAMPs by the vertebrate innate immune system [5] . Response to CpG ODN stimulation is conferred through TLR9, expressed mainly in the intracellular compartments of human B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) [6, 7] . Alarmed TLR9 is the initial instigator of gene expression profiles that strongly support antiviral mechanisms: upregulation of costimulatory molecules major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II, B7.1 and B7.2 on the surface of stimulated cells provides them with a stronger antigen presenting potential [8, 9] and production of cytokines such as type I interferon (IFN), interleukin (IL)-12, IFNγ, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α, contribute to providing an optimal immune environment for the development of innate and adaptive responses against intracellular pathogens [10, 11] . Probably the most important antiviral property of CpG ODN resides in their potential to stimulate the production of high amounts of type I IFN by pDCs [12] . This family of cytokines, which includes IFNα, IFNω and IFNβ, has been shown to considerably enhance natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity [13] , promote differentiation, maturation and immunostimulatory functions of monocytes and DCs [14] , induce B cell production of immunoglobulin [15] and T-helper (Th) 1 differentiation of T cells [16, 17] . Moreover, upon binding to their ubiquitously distributed receptor, type I IFNs effectively induce the synthesis of various intracellular proteins which interfere with the replication of a broad range of viruses [18] . The myxovirusresistance protein (Mx) GTPase is a well-studied example of these intracellular antiviral effectors. This enzyme is known to be directly regulated by the type I IFN, and its detection is readily used as marker for upregulation and biological activity of this cytokine family [19] .",
