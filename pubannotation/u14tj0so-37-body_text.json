    "text": "Iterative HFold is comprised of four different iterative methods. Following the description of each method, we motivate why we chose to include it as part of our overall algorithm. Iterative HFold takes as input both an RNA sequence, S and a pseudoknot-free secondary structure, G; later we show that structure G can be produced by computational methods, for example, HotKnots hotspots or SimFold suboptimal structures, when only the sequence S is initially available.",
