    "text": "HotKnots HotKnots is a heuristic program that given an RNA sequence, first finds about 20 lowest energy stems (from the set of all stems for the given RNA sequence), called hotspots. Then keeping all these stems, it adds other http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/147 non-overlapping low energy stems to the stems found in the first step, so as to minimize the energy of the overall structure, eventually producing up to 20 output structures. In our experiments, we choose the structure with the lowest energy value among the 20 output structures as the final structure predicted by HotKnots. When reporting prediction accuracy for HotKnots, we report the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval for the average F-measure of the lowest energy structure for all RNA sequences in our data set.",
