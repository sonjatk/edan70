    "text": "Gene knock-down experiments were conducted to determine the significance of CxCul4 during WNV infection. Hsu cells were transfected with long dsRNA against CxCul4, infected with WNV at 24 h post-transfection, and total RNA and supernatant media were collected at 48 hpi. As a control, cells were either left untransfected (No dsRNA) or were transfected with dsRNA against GFP (GFP dsRNA). Real-time RT-qPCR showed a significant decrease (>80%) in CxCul4 mRNA, indicating efficient knock-down of the gene (S4 Fig). There was also a significant decrease (>75%) in WNV NS1 RNA in cells treated with CxCul4 dsRNA, indicating a decrease in viral replication, compared to control (No dsRNA and GFP dsRNA) cells (Fig 3B) . Plaque assays conducted on supernatant media showed greater than 10-fold decrease in viral titers following CxCul4 knock-down (75 pfu/ml) compared with No dsRNA (900 pfu/ml) and GFP dsRNA (800 pfu/ml) (Fig 3C) . In a parallel experiment, western blots performed using Culex cullin (Cul4) is pro-viral. A. Female Culex annulirostris mosquitoes (n = 40) were infected with WNV by blood feeding. Mosquitoes were microdissected at 24 hpi and total RNA was collected from the midgut and the remaining carcass. Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using Culex cullin (Cul4) primers. RpL32 primers were used as an internal control. Error bars represent standard error from four pooled mosquitoes with assays performed in triplicate (Student's t-test *p < 0.05, comparing between control and WNV-infected carcasses and midguts). B. Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against Culex cullin (Cul4 dsRNA). No dsRNA or GFP dsRNA was used as a silencing control. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with WNV and total RNA was collected 48 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using WNV NS1-specific primers. RpL32 primers were used as internal control. Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments with assays performed in triplicate (*p < 0.05, comparing between No dsRNA, GFP dsRNA and Cul4-knock-down cells). C. Viral titer estimation by plaque assays conducted on the supernatant media collected from cells treated as in B. D. Western blot anti-NS5 antibody showed a significantly lower level of WNV NS5 in cells treated with CxCul4 dsRNA compared with control cells (GFP dsRNA) (Fig 3D) .",
