    "text": "Quascade has been designed for research applications characterized by strict high performance requirements. It provides a graphical, drag-and-drop interface to allow users to design and execute ad-hoc workflows. Workflows are constructed by an end-user by inter-connecting functional blocks, called components. A component is a piece of independent and self-contained code performing a given functionality on its input and generates an output. Data paths among components can be specified by drawing lines between/among the output(s) and input(s) of different components, respectively. Thereby, various combinations of these components (such as one output to multiple inputs, multiple outputs to multiple inputs) can be used to create any workflow depicting the flow of both data and logic.",
