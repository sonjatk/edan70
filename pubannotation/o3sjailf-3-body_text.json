    "text": "Patient T359 was a 13-month-old girl brought to the Amana District Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in June 2008 for fever (39.3°C), runny nose and cough for the past three days. She had no other symptoms, in particular no diarrhea, abdominal pain, vomiting or rash. Except for the elevated temperature, the patient's vital signs were normal (the respiratory rate was 35 breaths/min), there was no sign of severe sepsis or respiratory distress, and the detailed physical examination did not reveal any abnormality. The caregivers responded negatively to questions about the presence of acute disease in contact persons or chronic disease in the child. The leukocyte count (leukocytes 33 × 10 9 /L with a neutrophilic predominance), C-reactive protein (139.1 mg/mL) and procalcitonin levels (5.772 µg/L) were elevated. Other blood tests were within the normal range (hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL, alanine transaminase 43 U/L, hematocrit 29.1% and platelets 453 × 10 9 /L). The urine dipstick was positive for leukocytes, and thus the patient was treated with cotrimoxazole, but the urine culture was sterile. As mentioned, no viral, bacterial or parasitic agent was evidenced after a broad range of investigations, including blood culture. In particular, virological screening included the following specific real-time RT-PCR assays: influenza A and B; respiratory syncytial virus; metapneumovirus; PIV types 1 and 3; rhinovirus; enterovirus; coronavirus (HKU1, NL63, 229E and OC43); bocavirus; adenovirus; human herpesvirus 6; parvovirus B19; dengue; chikungunya; West Nile and Rift Valley viruses. She was also screened for antigen detection of adenovirus and rotavirus, and serological assays targeting IgM for Epstein − Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis A and E, mumps and measles were performed. The clinical diagnosis retained was a tracheobronchitis of unknown etiology.",
