    "text": "In order to explore the epidemiological effects of the various sampling methods, we compare each method with simulations run on the full network. The robustness of a sampling method is determined by whether the mean simulation for a method using a certain percentage of data lies within the 95% CIs of the mean of simulations run in the full network. We focus on key epidemiological quantities such as final size, peak size and epidemic duration. While it is informative to explore the effect of partial knowledge upon epidemic duration, for rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc. R. Soc. B 282: 20150205 many diseases livestock movement bans will be implemented as soon as cases are reported. We therefore also look at predictions of the epidemic size after 6 and 12 weeks using the different sampling methods. We denote the threshold at which a scheme fails to be robust as S min , the minimum sampling threshold. Initially, we set b ¼ 1 and T ¼ 21 days. Sensitivity to these parameter values is explored below (electronic supplementary material, figures S13-S16).",
