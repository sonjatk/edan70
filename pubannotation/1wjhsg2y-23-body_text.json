    "text": "Limited research effort has implications for assessing the conservation status of bat species in Western Asia and impedes our ability to identify imperiled species. A majority of bat species distributed in Western Asian countries are considered least concern (77%), and 9% of species lack sufficient information to even assess their conservation status (Figure 4a ). Yet, population trends for most bat species in Western Asia, including those classified as \"least concern,\" are largely unknown or decreasing (Figure 4b) , and additional research is needed to assess and prioritize species for conservation. Table S2 for species in each category).",
