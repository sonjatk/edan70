    "text": "Cutaneous samples showed a greater RQ of SQPV DNA than other tissues. Arm skin had the highest RQ of SQPV DNA (RQ mean = 1937 ± 3692 CI, n = 7), and digit skin was the second most intensely infected area (RQ mean = 24 ± 24 CI, n = 4) (Fig. 3a) . Of all cutaneous swabs taken, arm swabs yielded the most SQPV DNA (RQ mean = 29 ± 47 CI, n = 6). It appears virus is present over much of the body with all cutaneous swabs and tissue showing 100 % SQPV presence in infected individuals. In contrast to grey squirrels, non-cutaneous samples also showed high infection rates in red squirrels but with somewhat lower infection intensities when compared to cutaneous samples (Fig. 3b) . For example, blood showed the highest RQ of the non-cutaneous tissues tested (RQ mean = 0.097 ± 0.16 CI, n = 7), while rectal swabs provided the highest recovery of SQPV DNA (RQ mean = 0.23 ± 0.33 CI, n = 7); indeed, the recovery of SQPV from rectum was comparable to the relative quantity of SQPV DNA found in faeces (RQ mean = 0.18 ± 0.22 CI, n = 5).",
