    "text": "Research effort on bats is heavily biased geographically, in particular the United States, countries of Western Europe, China, Japan, India, Australia, and Brazil had the greatest number of published bat-related studies indexed on PubMed (Figure 3 ). Not surprisingly, overall bat research per country was positively correlated with bat species richness (r = 0.45, p < 0.001) (Table S3) , however many areas of central Africa and Southeast Asia with high species richness had a very low overall number of publications on bats. Globally, nearly half of all countries had less than five bat-related publications indexed in PubMed (42%, see Table S4 ). Western Asia, together with much of Africa, had some of the lowest numbers of bat-related publications, with a few exceptions. While half of all Western Asian countries have 10 or fewer publications on bats, a few countries reported relatively high publication counts, specifically Turkey and Israel (110 and 533 publications, respectively).",
