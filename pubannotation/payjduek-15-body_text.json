    "text": "Apart from those to confirm the measles infection, no laboratory investigations were undertaken to determine if additional viral pathogens were present in the patient and contributed to the development of the BCG reactivation. Human herpes virus 6 infection has been reported in an infant with a viral exanthem presenting with BCG reactivation [17] . In addition, various respiratory viruses including enterovirus, adenovirus, human rhinovirus and coronavirus have been isolated significantly more frequently in children with KD than in controls [18] , although no direct association with BCG reactivation have been documented. As viral co-infections have been identified in children with measles [19] , a more extensive virology work-up may have been warranted in our patient when the unusual finding of BCG reactivation was discovered.",
