    "text": "Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) can cause a significant impact on human-and animal health [1] [2] [3] and are often the product of a host shift, where a pathogen jumps from its original host to new species [4] . Prominent examples include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus or the still ongoing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) pandemic [3] [4] [5] . Pathogens and their novel hosts lack a co-evolutionary history, which can lead to drastic effects on host populations [6] . In particular, RNA viruses have a high potential to cross species barriers because of high mutation rates that enable fast adaptive changes [7, 8] , which make them prominent among EIDs [9] . Such RNA viruses have also been suggested to contribute to the recent decline of wild pollinators and losses of managed ones, thereby potentially endangering valuable pollination services [10] [11] [12] [13] . Thus, it is not surprising that virus transmission between managed honeybees, Apis mellifera, and wild bees has recently been speculated [14, 15] .",
