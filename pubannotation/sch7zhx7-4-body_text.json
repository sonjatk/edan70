    "text": "Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a positive-sense RNA virus, belonging to the Picornaviridae family. CVB3 commonly infects children, resulting in a self-limiting illness that can lead to the development of muscle, lung, and heart maladies. Importantly, CVB3 infection can lead to myocarditis and endocarditis, and the virus is able to persist in cardiac tissue [1, 2] . Currently, no antivirals are available for treating or preventing CVB3 infection; thus, the identification of novel antiviral targets is crucial to controlling infection. Viral proteases, including enteroviral proteases, play crucial roles in the replication of RNA viruses [3] . Following virus entry, picornavirus RNA is directly translated via host ribosomes into a polyprotein, containing both structural and nonstructural proteins. This large protein is subsequently cleaved to generate functionally distinct viral proteins. Importantly, the ability of viral proteases to cleave the viral polyprotein is essential for productive infection, as limiting viral protease activity significantly hinders virus infection. Modulation of protease activity, however, can also alter antiviral susceptibility [4] . Additionally, viral proteins cleave several host proteins, including translation factors, immune effectors, and signaling molecules [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] , to establish a proviral environment. ",
