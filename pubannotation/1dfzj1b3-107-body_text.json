    "text": "An inhibitory effect of Farfugium japonicum (L.) Kitamura essential oil, namely constituted by 1undecene, 1-nonene and Î²-caryophyllene, on NO and PGE 2 production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells were found by Kim et al. (2008) [144] , with a concomitant inhibition of iNOS and COX-2 mRNA expression, might explain the anti-inflammatory activity of this oil. The same authors in another work, and using the essential oil of Illicium anisatum L., mainly constituted by 1,8-cineole, also demonstrated its capacity for inhibiting NO and PGE 2 production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, along with the decrease of iNOS and COX-2 proteins and iNOS and COX-2 mRNA expression [145] .",
