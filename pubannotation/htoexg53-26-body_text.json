    "text": "The recombinant virus MVA-MERS-N produced stable amounts of MERS-CoV N antigen upon in vitro infection of human cells indicating the unimpaired expression of the target gene at the level of viral late transcription using the synthetic vaccinia virus-specific promoter PmH5 [46] . Moreover, the MERS-CoV N antigen produced in MVA-MERS-N infected cells was strongly recognized by antibodies from experimentally infected laboratory animals suggesting that N-specific immune responses were potently activated upon MERS-CoV infection. It seems noteworthy that MERS-CoV productively replicates in rabbits, but viral loads are low and the animals develop no overt disease symptoms. However, Haagmans et al. found infectious virus in the lung tissues of the rabbits and revealed the presence of the MERS-CoV N antigen in bronchiolar epithelial cells and in the epithelial cells of the nose [60] . The localization of N in these respiratory epithelial cells may result in an efficient recognition by innate and also adaptive immune cells similar to those described for other viruses inducing robust protective immunity [61] . This might be a possible explanation for efficient activation of MERS-CoV N-specific antibodies despite a barely productive MERS-CoV infection. Similar outcomes of infection were observed upon MERS-CoV infection in cynomolgus macaques and other relevant non-human primate models [62, 63] . Thus, the induction of N-specific immune responses in these animals emphasizes the potential usefulness of the MERS-CoV N protein to serve as vaccine antigen.",
