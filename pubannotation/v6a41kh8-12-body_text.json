    "text": "During a 3-year period from 29 June 2004 to 30 June 2007, we collected 2,230 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) specimens from equally many cases of pneumonia in 1,909 children (some children were included more than once). These children were, after obtaining informed parental consent, included in a study on zinc as adjuvant therapy for CAP (to be presented elsewhere). All included children were randomized to receive either 10 to 20 mg elemental zinc dispersed in water or placebo tablets daily for 14 days. Cases with very severe pneumonia/disease, that is, cough or difficult breathing with stridor when calm or any general danger signs (inability to drink/ breastfeed, persistent vomiting, convulsions, lethargy, or unconsciousness) were not included in the study, but instead referred to a tertiary level hospital after initial treatment. Other exclusion criteria are listed in the study profile ( Figure 1 ). Children could not participate in the study again until after 6 months due to the 6-month follow-up scheme of the clinical trial.",
