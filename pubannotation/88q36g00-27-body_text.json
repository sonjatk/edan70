To analyze the neonatal body weights, two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used, followed by a Bonferroni post-hoc test. The mRNA expression levels in astrocyte cultures were also analyzed by two-way ANOVA, followed by a Bonferroni post-hoc test. All other data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. The statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Values of p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
