    "text": "The initiation phase involves homolytic breakdown of hydrogen in the Î±-position relative to the fatty acid chain double bond, leading to the formation of an allyl radical. These species are highly unstable, short-lived intermediates that stabilize themselves by abstracting hydrogen from another chemical species or rapidly react with oxygen to form a peroxyl radical (propagation phase). In the propagation phase, peroxyl radicals formed can further oxidise the lipid, producing hydroperoxides.",
