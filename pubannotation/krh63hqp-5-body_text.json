    "text": "The literature suggests RNA viruses should be inherently subject to mutational degeneration [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . This includes the bacteriophage MS2 [14] , the tobacco etch virus [15] , HIV [16] [17] [18] [19] , dengue virus type-2 [20] , Ebola [21, 22] , and SARS [23, 24] . Some have suggested that intentionally increasing the rate of mutation accumulation (\"lethal mutagenesis\") may be a way to control viral epidemics by hastening strain extinction [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . There is some long-term historical evidence that supports the concept of natural viral attenuation through mutation accumulation [2] , and theoretical studies using numerical simulation strongly support the concept of natural and accelerated genetic attenuation of RNA viruses [13] .",
