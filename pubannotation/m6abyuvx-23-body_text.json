    "text": "To overcome the problem of immune tolerance in mouse models of HCV expression, we developed an HCV model in mice that relies on conditional expression of the core, E1, E2, and NS2 proteins and the Cre/loxP switching system [5, 6] ; we showed that the injection of an Ad-Cre vector enhanced the frequency of HCV-specific activated CD8 T cells in the liver of these mice and caused liver injury. However, the Ad-Cre adenovirus vector alone causes acute hepatitis in wild-type mice. Nevertheless, the transgenic model was useful for evaluating interactions between the host immune system and viral protein (serum ALT level over 2,000 IU/L) [5] ; HCV core protein levels were reduced and expression of this protein was transient (about 2 weeks). Therefore, this Ad-Cre-dependent model cannot be used to effectively investigate immune responses to chronic HCV hepatitis.",
