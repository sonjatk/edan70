    "text": "R6CN2 HCV cDNA (nt 294-3435) [37] and full genomic HCV cDNA (nt 1-9611) [38, 39] were cloned from a blood sample taken from a patient (#R6) with chronic active hepatitis (Text S1). The infectious titer of this blood sample has been previously reported [40] . R6CN2HCV and R6CN5HCV transgenic mice were bred with Mx1-Cre transgenic mice (purchased from Jackson Laboratory) to produce R6CN2HCV-MxCre and R6CN5HCV-MxCre transgenic mice, which were designated CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) and RzCN5-15 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice, respectively. Cre expression in the livers of these mice was induced by intraperitoneal injection of polyinosinic acid-polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, England); 300 mL of a poly(I:C) solution (1 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) was injected three times at 48-h intervals. All animal care and experimental procedures were performed according to the guidelines established by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science Subcommittee on Laboratory Animal Care.",
