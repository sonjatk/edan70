    "text": "The resulting Excel data sheet presents the CBF calculations as a report that allows the observer to obtain information about individual regions of interest or the image as a whole. Raw data (including pixel intensities and the power spectrum of the FFT ( Figure 1B) ) from individual regions of interest can be inspected using a drop-down menu. The results report displays the mean, median and modal CBFs of the field, and a histogram of the CBF of all regions of interest (Figure 2A) . A color chart of the intensity of the CBF for each regions of interest is also presented in Figure 2B .",
