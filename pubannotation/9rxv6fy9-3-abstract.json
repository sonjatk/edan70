    "text": "A direct approach to prevent the transmission of airborne-mediated disease is inactivation of the corresponding airborne pathogens, and in fact the airborne antimicrobial efficacy of ultraviolet (UV) light has long been established 6-8 . Germicidal UV light can also efficiently inactivate both drug-sensitive and multi-drug-resistant bacteria 9 , as well as differing strains of viruses 10 . However, the widespread use of germicidal ultraviolet light in public settings has been very limited because conventional UVC light sources are a human health hazard, being both carcinogenic and cataractogenic 11,12 .",
