    "text": "Two NHPs, the common marmoset and rhesus macaque model were established for MERS-CoV infection by three different research groups [49, [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] . The clinical symptoms included respiratory disease which was mild in nature and could be diagnosed with radio imaging and computed tomography [54, 56, 59] and respiratory disease of severe nature showing fatal clinical symptoms requiring euthanasia [54, 59] . Exposure to the MERS-0 infectious clone (icMERS-0) strain in Rhesus monkeys is reported to cause respiratory disease, wherein virus antigen has been detected. Respiratory disease in such cases was found to be transient and mild in nature, which resolved by 30 days from infection. Pulmonary disease was also found to be mild upon MERS-CoV infection in NHPs. Earlier studies found ocular, intratracheal or intranasal exposure of MERS-EMC isolate to cause lethal disease. However, it has been argued that lethality was due to manipulations of marmoset, which have higher sensitivity than macaque species [54, 57] . Cases of mild to moderate symptoms even after higher viral titer have also been reported in other studies [56] . Small animals, such as hamsters and mice, have been found to be resistant to MERS-CoV infection and development of models of severe respiratory disease has been a challenge [60] .",
