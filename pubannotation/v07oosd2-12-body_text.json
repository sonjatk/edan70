    "text": "A contradiction was found in the scientific literature concerning the impact of herd size on the prevalence of PWD in pigs. Indeed, Laine and collaborators reported that in Finland, the increase in pig's herd size was associated with a higher risk of PWD in pigs [38] . While, in Canada, Amezuca et al. [43] reported that PWD occurred on a variety of farm types and sizes. However, a link between stocking density and PWD was described in pig's farms in some countries [30, 44] . Mixing piglets from different farms is a common practice in pig husbandry, particularly at weaning. This mixing can result in fighting as the pigs strive to establish dominance relationships, with most aggressive interactions being typically shown during the first few hours after grouping [45] . It has been reported that the hierarchical behaviour among pigs leads to very significant differences in food and water consumption on farms [46] . Production based on segregated sow parities was proposed as a solution to reduce the impact of the social hierarchy. This system of grouping according to the sow's farrowing rank reduces disease challenge by reducing variation in the immune status of the piglets [47] .",
