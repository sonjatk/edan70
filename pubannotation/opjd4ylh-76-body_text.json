    "text": "The findings of this study revealed that nurses need well-ventilated TB wards in the hospital. The TB wards layout was not suitable and lacked ventilation, which increased risk of TB spread. The working environment was not safe and did not meet the national standards guidelines for a TB ward setting, as recommended by South Africa [31] . According to the study by Narasimhan et al. [32] , overcrowding and poorly ventilated environments increase the risk of acquiring TB.",
