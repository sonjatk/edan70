    "text": "Respiratory viral infection can damage and impede the repair of respiratory epithelial cells leading to reduced mucociliary clearance. Consequently, bacteria can more easily enter the lungs to cause pneumonia [75] . Many of the virus-bacteria interaction mechanisms involve viral compromise of the innate immune system. These include impairment and depletion of resident alveolar macrophages [101] [102] [103] and neutrophils, which are necessary for bacterial clearance, mediated by induction of type I interferons [104] and desensitization to Toll-like receptor ligands [105] . Detailed descriptions of potential biological pathways involved in these mechanisms are discussed in earlier reviews by Robinson et al. [55] and McCullers [9] . Finally, excessive inflammation in the lungs due to virus-initiated exacerbation of inflammatory mediators, cytokines and chemokines, can cause tissue damage [6] , which increases susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections.",
