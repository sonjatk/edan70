The ''top'' narrow end of the β-propeller funnel of WDR48 interacts with the tip of the USP Fingers subdomain, whereas the WDR48 ancillary domain (AD) and sumo-like domain (SLD) curve around ubiquitin, which binds in the Palm region of the DUB. The C-terminal glycine residue and tail of ubiquitin extend towards the active site cysteine of the DUB. While Yin et al. (2015) and Dharadhar et al. (2016) crystallized their complexes in the presence of an ubiquitin-bound substrate, Li et al. (2016) crystallized USP12 in complex with WDR48 and WDR20 in the absence of bound-ubiquitin, providing additional structural insight. For example, the ''Pinky Finger'' β-sheet of the Fingers subdomain appears disordered or displaced in apoUSP12, whereas the four antiparallel β-sheets of the Fingers subdomain are rigid in other USP structures (Hu et al., 2002; Avvakumov et al., 2006; Ratia et al., 2006; Renatus et al., 2006; Yin et al., 2015) . Binding of WDR48 to the tip of the Fingers subdomain stabilizes the ''Pinky Finger'' and Fingers subdomain, which may ultimately propagate to the catalytic cleft in the presence of substrate (Li et al., 2016) . WDR20 also binds the DUB via the ''top'' face of its β-propeller but interacts with the bottom of the palm subdomain of USP12 to promote an optimal alignment of the catalytic cleft (Li et al., 2016) . Together, these structural studies suggest that binding of the WDR proteins to USP12 or USP46 relatively far from the active site results in the rearrangement of several structural elements, which propagates to the catalytic triad increasing enzyme catalysis.",
