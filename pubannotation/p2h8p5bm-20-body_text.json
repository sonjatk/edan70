    "text": "The host cell detects invading pathogens through PRRs, which recognize foreign molecular patterns that are generated during infection. The particular PRR involved in the recognition of the pathogen depends on the infecting virus [108] . In flavivirus infection, the most important PRRs are Toll-like receptor (TLR)3, TLR7, TLR8, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5 (MDA-5). TLR3 recognizes double stranded (ds) RNA, which is formed as an intermediate during flavivirus replication [113, 114] . TLR7 and 8, which are located in the endosomes, recognize single stranded (ss) RNAs, such as the genomic RNA of flaviviruses [95, [115] [116] [117] . RIG-I and MDA-5 recognize viral RNA in the cytoplasm of infected cells; RIG-I recognizes short dsRNA and 5 triphosphorylated and 5 diphosphorylated ssRNA, whereas MDA-5 recognizes long dsRNA [118] [119] [120] .",
