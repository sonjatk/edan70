    "text": "JEV infection of NEC is associated with limited cell death. In NEC cultures, JEV induced limited cell death, visualized as increased membrane permeability (dark blue in Fig. 3A ). This cell death was at least partially mediated by apoptosis since cleaved caspase 3 was detected in the infected cultures (red in Fig. 3B ). Relating to the higher rate of infection, the Laos strain induced more cell death than the Nakayama strain.",
