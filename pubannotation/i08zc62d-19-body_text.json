    "text": "We have extracted natural geranylated flavonoids from P. tomentosa and shown that they exhibit notable kinetic properties against sialidase from C. perfringens, a bacterium causing various gastrointestinal diseases. We also found that diplacone is the most effective inhibitor among these flavonoids. This inhibitor also shows a time-dependent competitive inhibition pattern. The crystal structure of the Cp-NanI catalytic domain in complex with diplacone rationalized how the geranyl and C3 0 hydroxyl groups of diplacone contribute to the stability of the enzyme-inhibitor complex (Table 2) . From the structural information described above, we suggest further modification strategies of diplacone to improve its inhibitory properties against C. perfringens NanI. In the Cp-NanI-diplacone complex, two water molecules (W1 and W2) mediate hydrogen bonds between Cp-NanI residues (Arg285 and Asp328 with W1 and Gln493, Thr538 and Tyr587 with W2) of the catalytic site and diplacone atoms (O1 with W1 and C4 with W2) ( Table 2 and Fig. 2b) . Introducing polar moieties such as carboxylic and amino groups at the O1 or C4 positions of diplacone may possibly improve binding affinity in the Cp-NanI catalytic site through the formation of additional hydrogen bonds. Addition of hydrophobic groups, including phenyl, benzyl and cyclohexyl groups, to C3 of diplacone may also increase the binding affinity via hydrophobic contact with the hydrophobic patch (Phe353, Trp354 and Phe460) of the enzyme. Furthermore, aryl groups (phenyl or benzyl) may form a potential dipole-dipole interaction with Phe353.",
