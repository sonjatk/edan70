    "text": "We evaluated the ability of HIVIG and a panel of mAbs with variable neutralizing activities to mediate pH-dependent transcytosis with fully infectious HIV-1 JRFL ; 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) of the antibodies ranged from 0.06 to .50 mg/ml (Fig. 3E ). Both poorly neutralizing antibodies (HIVIG and mAbs b6 and F240; Figure 3A ) and neutralizing mAbs (4E10, 2F5, 2G12, VRC01, and b12; Figure 3B ) enhanced transcytosis at pH 6.0. At 50 mg/ml, transcytosis correlated directly with mAb binding to HIV-1 JRFL (Spearman rho = 0.75; p = 0.052) and inversely with the IC 50 of the mAbs (Spearman rho = 20.71; p = 0.050) ( Figure S5 ). At pH 6.0, all Env-specific mAbs and HIVIG mediated transcytosis of virus that infected TZM-bl cells ( Figure 3C and D). However, there was a strong correlation between the amount of transcytosed infectious virus and the neutralizing activity (IC 50 ) of the antibody that mediated the transcytosis (Spearman's rho = 0.86; p = 0.001). Virus whose transcytosis was mediated by poorly neutralizing antibodies HIVIG, F240 and b6, at least at concentrations of 100 and 50 mg/ml, was more infectious than virus which crossed the epithelial cells in a non-FcRn-dependent manner (i.e., in the presence of Den3 control mAb) (Fig. 3C) . Conversely, transcytosis mediated by antibodies with the lowest IC 50 s, such as VRC01 and b12, resulted in less infectious virus than was observed with the Den3 control antibody ( Figure 3D ). Thus, strong binding activity results in more FcRn-dependent transcytosis, whereas strong neutralizing activity renders the transcytosed virus less infectious.",
