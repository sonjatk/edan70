    "text": "Given that we had observed resistance mutations in both 2A and 3C proteases after passaging virus in polyamine-depleted cells, we hypothesized that viral protease activity may be modulated by cellular polyamines. While previous reports have suggested that polyamines enhance chymotrypsin activity [32, 33] , a role for polyamines in viral protease activity has never been reported. Toward this end, we treated cells with increasing doses of DFMO or DENSpm to deplete cellular polyamines. Following incubation with a drug, cells were infected at MOI 10 for 24 h, at which time cellular lysates were collected for western analysis. Lysates were analyzed for the presence of cleaved eIF4G, a cellular target of the viral proteases. We observed that in infected cells, a distinct eIF4G band was present; however, in cells treated either with DFMO or DENSpm, eIF4G cleavage was significantly restricted ( Figure 4A ). We were unable to visualize full-length eIF4G, likely due to its large size.",
