    "text": "It is important that studies of this system are based on reliable and accurate diagnostics. SQPV infection status was initially determined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Scott and Keymer 1981) , but more recently conventional PCR ) and qPCR (Atkin et al. 2010; Fiegna et al. 2016 ) assays have been developed. As grey squirrels appear asymptomatic, lower infection loads are recorded, and thus it is essential to use the more sensitive qPCR assays when screening for SQPV presence as part of a wildlife disease management programme for red squirrels. For SADV infection, confirmation has relied on either TEM (Everest et al. 2008) or conventional qualitative PCR assays (Everest et al. 2009b) . No assay for either pathogen has incorporated an IC (either exogenous or endogenous). Additionally, the use of ICs to monitor squirrel pathogens is essential because staphylococcal exudative dermatitis (Simpson et al. 2010 (Simpson et al. , 2013a and rotaviral enteritis (Everest et al. 2009a) show similar lesions to SQPV and SADV, respectively. This presents a clear opportunity for misdiagnosis (in the absence of other diagnostic tests) if the pathogen assay reports a false negative, for example due to unrecognised presence of PCR inhibitors.",
