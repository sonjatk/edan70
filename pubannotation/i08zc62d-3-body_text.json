    "text": "On the other hand, pathogenic bacteria having resistance to pre-existing drugs occasionally cause fatal infectious diseases. The need to combat these superbugs mandates the development of new drugs overcoming antibacterial resistance. Various pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus pneumoniae express sialidases. These enzymes specifically catalyze the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acids from glycoconjugates (Shinya et al., 2006) and play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of a number of microbial diseases, including cholera, enterotoxaemia, gas gangrene and pneumonia (Corfield, 1992; Rood, 1998) . Therefore, bacterial sialidases have recently emerged as a prominent target for the treatment of bacterial infections (Nguyen et al., 2010; Woo et al., 2011) . The latest studies on sequelae of sepsis and septic shock have focused on understanding the roles of bacterial pathogenic factors (Rittirsch et al., 2008) . Moreover, studies using a sialidase deletion mutant from P. aeruginosa showed that bacterial sialidase acts in the initial stages of pulmonary infection by targeting glycoconjugates and biofilm production (Soong et al., 2006) .",
