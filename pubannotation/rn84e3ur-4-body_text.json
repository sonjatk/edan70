    "text": "Recently, studies on the aerodynamic effects of human movement have received more and more attentions [9] . Significant works have been done on this issue, as summarized in Table 1 . In experimental investigations, Matsumoto and Ohba [10] , Poussou et al. [11] and Bj√∏rn and Nielsen [12] showed that human movement inside enclosed environments could significantly influence contaminant transport and personal exposures to contaminants. By using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods, more studies were performed in different indoor environments. Simple human models [13] [14] [15] and realistic walking human models [16, 17] were used as the walking humans in the simulations. Most of these studies [13, 14, 16, 17] used tracer gas as the contaminant, but gaseous contaminants were not accurate enough to represent the transmission of respiration droplets. Wang and Chow [17] and Choi and Edwards [15, 16] studied the influence of human walking on the dispersion and deposition of expiratory droplets in indoor environment. Among previous literatures, significant differences can be found in their methods and conclusions.",
