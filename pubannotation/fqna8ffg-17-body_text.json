    "text": "In summary our results suggested a pivotal role of structural lung cells, in particular ATII cells, for the production and release of neutrophil attracting CXCL chemokines within the acute inflammatory response after CNP instillation. Alveolar macrophages in contrast seem not involved and do not get activated within the first 12 h after CNP exposure, despite of their prominent particle loading.",
