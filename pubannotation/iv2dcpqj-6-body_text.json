    "text": "Different groups of viruses, such as tombusvirus (TBSV), human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) and West Nile virus (WNV), utilize eEF1A as cofactor for viral transcription, translation and assembly. For TBSV, eEF1A facilitates the assembly of the TBSV replicase and stimulates minus-strand synthesis [21] . The HIV-1 Nef protein enhances the resistance to stress-induced apoptosis in primary human macrophages through the nuclear-cytoplasmic transport of eEF1A and tRNAs. Moreover, eEF1 complex subunits are critical HIV-1 reverse transcription cofactors [22, 23] . In addition, the BVDV NS5A was also shown to interact with eEF1A [24] . Considering CSFV, BVDV, HCV and WNV are all Flaviviridae members, we suppose that the CSFV NS5A protein possibly interacts with eEF1A or affects the CSFV growth in host cells. In this study, we identified the host protein eEF1A as a novel NS5A-interacting partner that negatively regulates the growth of CSFV.",
