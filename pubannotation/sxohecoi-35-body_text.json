    "text": "The soluble Env binding assay was performed as previously described with some modifications [70] . Briefly, wells were coated with 250 ng of a gp120 Env specific anti-C5-antibody (D7324 [Aalto Bioscience]), washed and blocked with 4% non-fat dry milk. Serial dilutions of detergent-solubilized HIV-1 JR-FL (starting at 150 ng p24) was added and incubated for 2 hours at 37uC. Plates were then incubated with a constant concentration of antibodies (1 mg/mL) for 1 hour at 37uC followed by detection and development steps as described above.",
