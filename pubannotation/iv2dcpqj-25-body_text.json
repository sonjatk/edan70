    "text": "A Matchmaker two-hybrid system (catalog no. 630489; Clontech) was used to screen host proteins that interact with NS5A. Briefly, the bait construct pGBKT7-NS5A (BD-NS5A) was transformed into the yeast strain Y2HGold and hybridized with a cDNA library derived from porcine macrophages [39] . Transformants were selected for growth on synthetically defined (SD) medium lacking His, Leu, Trp and Ade (SD/-4) for 3 to 6 days at 30˝C. The clones were then transferred to SD/-4 medium containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-D-galactopyranoside (X-α-Gal) and aureobasidin A (Aba) (SD/-4/X-α-Gal/Aba). Blue colonies were selected and inoculated with 5 mL of SD/-4 medium for shaking culture at 30˝C for 1 to 3 days. Yeast plasmids were extracted using a yeast plasmid kit (catalog no. D3376; Omega, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the target inserts were verified by sequencing using the Gal4 AD and 3 1 AD primers. To validate the interaction between NS5A and the cellular proteins, the bait and prey plasmids were cotransformed into the Y2HGold yeast strain using a yeast transformation system 2 (catalog no. 630439; Clontech). The interaction between murine p53 and SV40 large T-antigen was used as a positive control, and the human lamin C protein, which does not interact with the SV40 large T-antigen, was included as a negative control.",
