    "text": "According to the findings of this study, nurses experience stress, frustration, and pain due to the conditions of TB patients and they perceive their job as one of the hardest since it deals with emotions. Nurses always go to an extent of risking their lives in order to save lives. When they fail, they always feel bad and become emotionally frustrated. This study shows that, there is a high death rate in the TB wards of Tshilidzini Hospital, and when a patient dies, nurses feel sad and hurt. The findings of this study agree with those of the study by Khalid et al. [27] , which showed that participants also experienced a variety of emotions when nursing patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and not knowing what they were facing.",
