    "text": "We have analyzed a publicly available BXD steady-state, whole-lung transcriptome data set generated from 51 BXD strains (Alberts et al. 2011) to interrogate the molecular phenotype of the pulmonary myocardium. Based on the assumption that genes with highly correlated expression in a tissue are likely to act in a common network or biological process, Alberts et al. (2011) previously identified gene networks associated with specific B-and T-cell populations from this same whole-lung data set. We reasoned that we could use a similar approach with the lung data set to identify and characterize pulmonary myocardium cells using the cardiac troponin I type 3 (Tnni3) gene (previously shown to be expressed in pulmonary myocardium) (Millino et al. 2000) by investigating highly correlated transcripts associated with cardiac muscle. This yielded 24 transcripts significantly correlated with the expression of Tnni3, which form the basis of a pulmonary myocardium gene network.",
