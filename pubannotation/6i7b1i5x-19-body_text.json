    "text": "In addition to protein, the ICIs observed in the limited bronchial epithelial samples were also partially composed of RNA. While the RNA could be of viral origin it is important to note that many of the host-derived intracellular protein aggregates previously noted also contain host mRNA [113, 114, 116, 117] . It is reasonable to conclude that if the ICIs observed in KD patients were related to one of these structures, they would positively stain for RNA.",
