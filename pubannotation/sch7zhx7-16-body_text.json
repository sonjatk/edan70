    "text": "Prism 6 (GraphPad) was used to generate graphs and perform statistical analysis. For all analyses, two-tailed Student's t-test was used to compare groups, unless otherwise noted, with a = 0.05. For tests of sample proportions, p values were derived from calculated Z scores with two tails and a = 0.05. Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were calculated using Prism 6 using the built-in analysis tool.",
