    "text": "In this review, we examine two hypotheses that argue the etiology of bacterial pneumonia is a consequence of ecologic selection influenced by the interaction of respiratory viruses and bacteria within the host: (i) respiratory viruses influence the etiology of pneumonia by altering bacterial carriage structure in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and (ii) respiratory viruses promote or inhibit colonization of the lower respiratory tract (LRT) by certain bacterial species residing in the URT. We begin by describing the normal processes of bacterial selection in the upper and LRTs and then present evidence on how these processes can potentially be altered by respiratory viruses.",
