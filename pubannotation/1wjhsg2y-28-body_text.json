    "text": "As with publications on bats, research effort on bat-associated viruses is heavily skewed towards the United States, a country with a nationwide surveillance program for monitoring and reporting of rabies virus infections since 1938 [50] , followed by Australia, China, northern and central Europe, Japan, and Brazil ( Figure 5 ). Again, research effort was significantly correlated with bat species richness (r = 0.47, p < 0.001) although with high variance (Table S3 ). While Western Asia contains \"hotspot\" areas predicted to be high risk for emerging infectious zoonotic diseases [22] , there have been very few publications on bat-associated viruses in Western Asia ( Figure 5 , Table 1 ). Of the 20 countries comprising Western Asia, only two have more publications on bat-associated viruses than the global average of 20 publications/country, specifically Jordan and Saudi Arabia (21 and 29 publications indexed on PubMed, respectively). However, our analysis of published literature is likely a vast overestimation of the amount of true bat-associated virus research occurring in the region. Many publications identified in the keyword searches are review papers or experimental laboratory studies that reference bats as an origin host, or follow up studies from MERS-CoV investigations in other hosts (i.e., dromedary camels). The number of surveillance or discovery studies on bat-associated viruses in Western Asia is scant, with a study on hantaviruses in bats from Georgia [123] being one of the few non-CoV publications from the region. rabies virus infections since 1938 [50] , followed by Australia, China, northern and central Europe, Japan, and Brazil ( Figure 5 ).
