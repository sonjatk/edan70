    "text": "Limitations of the software depend largely on image quality (pixel size) and the number of frames captured. We have used the ciliaFA software to examine AVI files of different lengths, captured at different frame rates (data not shown). We found that videos captured using high-speed video cameras that capture at rates at least 120 frames per second with a length of 128 frames (to give a frequency resolution of 0.94) will give valid data. These settings capture an appropriate number of ciliary beat cycles to accurately average the CBF; the lower the frequency resolution (that is, the more frames captured), the greater the accuracy of CBF. To allow the videos to be used for beat pattern analysis high-speed video cameras that capture at rates exceeding 250 frames per second should be used. The ciliaFA software has the capability to crop frames from large files to speed up the calculation of frequency without reducing the frequency resolution. For high-frequency analysis, we recommend that the microscope bulb is connected to a stable power source of at least 110 volt AC/60 Hz; lower voltages may cause the bulb to flicker within the CBF range and this will enhance background noise. We also recommend that the image is not subject to downstream processing, such as enhanced pixel gain, as this will also enhance background noise.",
