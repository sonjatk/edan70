    "text": "In many cases, infection by extra-cellular pathogens has been shown to alter NF-κB activity in order to facilitate the survival of pathogens or host. As part of the host defense mechanism against invading pathogens, NF-κB activation is required for resistance to a variety of viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections [1] . However, many viruses such as HIV, exploit this property to their benefit by driving their gene expression through κB response elements located in their promoters [2] . On the contrary, many pathogens such as African swine fever virus, HIV-1 and cowpox virus [3] [4] [5] have developed strategies to interfere with host NF-κB responses. Inhibition of NF-κB activity by these pathogens has been shown to be important for pathogenesis.",
