    "text": "Locally, the coverage of the 7-valent or 10-valent and 13valent vaccines was 65% and 90%, respectively [2] . The parents reported that the child received one prior dose of 7-valent vaccine before 3 years of age in early 2010. It is possible that 19A was a commonly circulating strain before the introduction of the 10-valent or 13-valent vaccines. The 13-valent vaccine should stop circulation of 19A when the program is fully implemented.",
