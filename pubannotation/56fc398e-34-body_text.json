    "text": "When markets are included the pattern of spatial spread is found to be similar to that without markets (electronic supplementary material, figure S12). The three most highly infected counties on the full network are Cumbria, North Yorkshire and Aberdeenshire, with mean epidemic sizes of 210, 258 and 238, respectively. When markets are included, we observe much larger epidemics in Devon, Somerset and northeast Wales. We also observe that each of the three sampling methods compares well with the original network at the S min threshold. Similar results are observed when outbreaks are seeded in Aberdeenshire and Devon-transmission within markets results in outbreaks with a much larger spatial extent than outbreaks in which markets do not play a role in transmission (electronic supplementary material, figures S21-S24).",
