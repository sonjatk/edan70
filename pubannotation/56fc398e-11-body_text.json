    "text": "Four methods of sampling from this database are implemented and compared here. A directed weighted-static adjacency matrix A [38] was constructed for each set of sampled data, in which nodes represent farms and edges represent (directed) cattle movements. An edge a ij is defined to be non-zero if cattle are moved from farm i to farm j during the year. The weight of the edge represents the frequency of movements from farm i to farm j in 2010 (i.e. the total number of days on which movements occurred divided by 365).",
