    "text": "x is the spatial location c is the pathogen concentration in the expiratory fluid, 10 6 pfu/ ml for the SARS-CoV [39] . p is the pulmonary ventilation rate, 7.5 l/min [18] . f(t) is the viability function of pathogens in the aerosols. Since the SARS-CoV may retain its infectivity for minutes and gradual loss for as long as several days [40, 41] , the viability function of the SARS-CoV is taken as 75% after aerosolization and remains the same during the first a few minutes [22, 40, 41] . m is the total number of size bins. N c is the total quantity of pathogens produced in a cough, N c = V c c, where V c is the total volume of the droplets produced in a cough, 6.7 × 10 -3 ml [18, 42] h l is the ratio of the number of droplets of the lth size bin in a cough to the number of injected particles in the numerical model, in which the number of droplets of the lth size bin can be calculated according to the original size distribution of the cough and V c . v(x,t) is the volume density of expiratory droplets in the breathing zone of the subject induced by one cough, ml/l of air. The breathing zone of each passenger can be defined as a hemisphere with 0.3 m radius at the nose [18] . For the human model used in this work, the volume of the breathing zone is 0.005721 m 3 for each passenger. Then v(x,t) can be calculated according to the CFD simulation results as the total volume of all the expiratory droplets in the breathing zone divided by the volume of the breathing zone [43] . β l is the respiratory deposition fraction of the aerosols of the lth size bin, %, which can be calculated according to the size and deposition location of the aerosols [44] . According to the infection mechanism of SARS, the human angiotensin 1-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) has been confirmed to be the receptor of the SARS-CoV. The hACE2 can be detected in ciliated airway epithelial cells of human airway tissues derived from nasal and tracheobronchial regions. And the infectivity of the SARS-CoV on the ciliated airway epithelial cells derived from nasal and tracheobronchial regions shows no difference [45] . So the aerosols that deposit in the head airway and tracheobronchial regions of the respiratory tract can be accounted in the intake dose [44] . It was tedious and time-consuming to model every cough during the exposure time interval to obtain v(x,t) at different locations. Considering other aerodynamic size-dependent factors, a stochastic non- Table 4 The cases investigated in the numerical simulation threshold dose-response model for airborne pathogens can be formed [38] :",
