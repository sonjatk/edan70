    "text": "Surveys have shown that the percentage of infected cats is not negligible in some endemic areas (Table 2 ). In cats, disease and infection may persist for very long periods and cats have been shown to be infectious to sand flies in experimental xenodiagnosis studies both in the Old and New Worlds. They may, therefore, play some role in the transmission of L. infantum in regions where many cats are infected [43] .",
