    "text": "(2) and shown in Figure 6 ; a 1 and a 2 are the rates that demonstrate how often the moving person walks in the airplane at moving speeds of 0.5 m/s and 1.0 m/s during the coughs of the index patient, a 1 + a 2 â‰¤1. By using likelihood analysis, the likelihood values under a range of quanta generation rate values, a 1 and a 2 can be obtained (data not shown). The result shows that the maximum likelihood is still 0.414 when the quanta generation rate is 0.141 million and both of a 1 and a 2 are zero. So the no movement assumption best represents the outbreak case. This result fits with the findings of a previous study, which analyzed a multi-drug resistant tuberculosis outbreak case in an airplane cabin by using likelihood analysis [18] . Yin et al. [18] did not simulate human movement but using a 'mixing ratio' concept to analyze the effect of human movement on the transmission of infectious disease. It was also found in the tuberculosis case that the likelihood reached maximum at mixing ratio close to zero, which indicated that human movement only had insignificant effect on the airborne transmission of respiratory infectious diseases.",
