    "text": "HeLa SS6, HeLa TZM-bl, and HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. HeLa-K b cells were cultivated in DMEM with additional 1 mg/mL geneticin. All cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Gibco (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). CEMx174 cells were cultured in RPMI Media 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) inactivated FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Confluent monolayers of HeLa cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Twenty-four hours post transfection cells were lysed in radio immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)) containing protease inhibitor cocktail Complete (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF).",
