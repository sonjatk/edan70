    "text": "Initially, DPPH radical was thought to be reduced to the corresponding hydrazine when it reacted with the donating hydrogen substances. However, more recent studies have shown that what occurs is mainly a fast electron transfer from the sample to DPPH radical. The abstraction of hydrogen from the sample by DPPH radical is marginal, because it occurs very slowly and depends on the hydrogen-bond accepting solvent. Methanol and ethanol, solvents generally used for antioxidant ability assays, are strongly hydrogen bond-accepting, therefore the hydrogen-abstracting reaction occurs very slowly [5] .",
