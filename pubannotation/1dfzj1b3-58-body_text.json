    "text": "Lavander (Lavandula angustifolia) oil, as reported above, was the most effective against lipid peroxidation [42] . Concerning free radical-scavenging activity, lavender essential oil also exhibited the highest DPPH-scavenging activity, neverthelesss in the ABTS-scavenging activity, the best oils were those of Mentha x piperita L and Boswellia carteri Birdw. In the DPPH method, limonene had similar activity of that of Lavandula angustifolia, although linalool and linalyl acetate constituted the major components of this essential oil. Limonene predominating in the Citrus x limon (L.) Burm. f. oil did not icorrespond to the best activity.",
