    "text": "Data from Banfield Pet Hospital Â® visits between 2008 and 2012 showed that older cats are more highly represented among cases of chronic gastrointestinal disease (8) . Because of this, it was considered that age may have been associated with more severe clinical disease; however, no significant correlation was observed between age and vomiting occurrence within this study population. Previous studies evaluating diagnostic outcomes of cats with chronic gastroenteropathy have shown that older cats (mean ages ranging from 9.3 to 12.6 years) were more likely to have an underlying neoplastic etiology compared to younger populations (mean age 7.7-8.9 years) (13, 14) . The population in this present study was relatively younger (mean age of 7.2 years) and likely had less severe disease than those evaluated in previous studies at tertiary referral practices. Given the risk of underlying neoplastic disease in cats with chronic gastroenteropathy, dietary intervention in conjunction with additional diagnostics is warranted in older patients.",
