    "text": "Observing the development of resistance to DFMO and the emergence of mutants in the passaged virus, we cloned these mutations in the CVB3 parental strain using mutagenic PCR on the CVB3 infectious clone. In addition to 2A 29K and 3C 52R mutants, we generated a 2A 29K /3C 52R double mutant. After confirming the presence of the mutations, we generated an infectious virus and measured the virus titer over several rounds of replication. Vero cells were treated with 500 ÂµM DFMO or left untreated for four days prior to infection at MOI 0.01. Cellular supernatant samples were collected and titered via plaque assay. As shown in Figure 2A , all viruses in untreated conditions replicated with similar kinetics and to similar levels regardless of protease mutation. However, in DFMO-treated cells, the wildtype CVB3 exhibited significant reductions in titer, which persisted to 72 hpi. Interestingly, the protease mutants, either alone or in combination, exhibited a Following passage of virus, RNA was extracted, purified, reverse transcribed and Sanger sequenced. When the sequenced virus was aligned with the parental CVB3 genome, mutations in the two viral proteases, 2A (Q29K) and 3C (Q52R), were observed. Interestingly, these mutations were observed independently in three distinct viral lineages. Further, the 2A 29K and 3C 52R mutations were not observed in the same lineage. Importantly, no mutations were observed in viruses passaged without treatment.",
