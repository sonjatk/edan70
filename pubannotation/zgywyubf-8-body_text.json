    "text": "Further, we examined the turnover of IκBα in IΚKβ and ORF2 co-expressing cells since IκBα is the major inhibitor of NF-κB activity in unstimulated cells. By performing a pulse chase assay, using [ 35 S]-cys/met labeling mix, the half-life of IκBα in IKKβ expressing cells was found to be approximately 90 minutes, whereas in cells expressing both IKKβ and ORF2, approximately 15% of Heterologous expression of ORF2 protein inhibits NF-κB activity. (A) Huh7 cells were cotransfected in duplicate with NF-κB CAT reporter and pSGI vector or pSGI-ORF2 expression plasmid. 48 hour post transfection, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml TPA for 30 minutes and CAT activity was assayed. Spot intensity was quantified using NIH Image program and percentage CAT activity was calculated assuming the highest value as 100%.",
