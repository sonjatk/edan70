    "text": "Of the 100 probes, 76 had unique Entrez Gene IDs (Table S3 in File S2). These genes were considered to be part of a pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network. This extended gene network contained a number of transcription factors (Tbx5, Hand2, Fhl2, and Gata4) and ion/calcium handling genes (Ank2, Cacna2d2, Scn5a, Kcnd2, Kcnj5, Myoz2, Casq2, Csrp3, and Gja3) of interest in the context of atrial fibrillation. We used this pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network to investigate enriched GO terms, signaling pathways, and human phenotypes related to the coexpression of these genes in the lung using WebGestalt . The pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network was significantly enriched with GO terms involving biological processes related to both striated and cardiac muscle function and development (Table 5) . Enriched molecular functions included cytoskeletal protein binding and cation transmembrane transporter activity (Table 5) , and enriched cellular components included contractile fiber and sarcomeric genes (Table 5) . Collectively, these data support our approach for identifying genes that are likely to be expressed in the pulmonary myocardium, as our coexpressed genes are indeed enriched for cardiac muscle function.",
