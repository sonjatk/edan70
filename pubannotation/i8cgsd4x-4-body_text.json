    "text": "Here we use an unbiased approach of transcriptome analysis by deep sequencing of the Culex cell transcriptome to identify genes that are differentially regulated following WNV infection. The results show multiple cellular pathways are involved during infection. Using mosquito infection studies in vitro and in vivo, we determine that the ubiquitin-proteasomal system plays a major role during WNV infection in mosquitoes. We also show that Culex cullin (orthologous to mammalian Cul4A/B) is induced by WNV infection and blocks Jak-STAT signalling, increasing WNV replication.",
