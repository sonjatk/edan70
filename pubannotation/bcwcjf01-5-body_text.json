    "text": "In 2009, the number of rabid foxes in Humboldt County infected with the CA skunk variant increased 356% from an average of 1-2 per year in the preceding 15 years to 7 in the latter months of 2008 to 38 in 2009 (Annual Reports from California Department of Public Health, Veterinary Public Health Section). In 2009, only 2 skunks were reported rabid in Humboldt County suggesting that rabies infections in foxes had fundamentally shifted from a typical pattern of spillover from skunks to foxes to one resulting from fox-to-fox transmission. The reported numbers underestimate the extent of the outbreak since additional foxes exhibiting unusual or aggressive behavior were euthanized but not tested (S. Chandler, USDA, personal communication). This epizootic of rabies in Northern California raised concerns not only because the primary species involved was gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and not striped skunks which are the terrestrial reservoir species in this region, but also because this led to a significant spike in attacks by rabid animals on humans and their pets [12] .",
