    "text": "DENV. We next performed an inhibition experiment in C6/36 cells derived from Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Surprisingly, the inhibitors had no effect on DENV titers in C6/36 cells (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material), suggesting that the inhibitors may be targeting a factor(s) or pathway(s) that is expressed only in cells of human origin. Dengue virus inhibitors block viral replication. We next determined the IC 50 s of N-desmethylclozapine, fluoxetine, and salmeterol in Huh-7 cells infected with DENV-2. Cells were infected with DENV-2 and treated with increasing concentrations of each of the inhibitors, and viral titers were measured by plaque assays at 24 h p.i. The IC 50 s of N-desmethylclozapine, fluoxetine hydrochloride, and salmeterol xinafoate were 1 M, 0.38 M, and 0.67 M, respectively (Fig. 2a to c) . To further verify the stage of the viral life cycle that is affected by the addition of these inhibitors, we prepared total cell lysates at 24 h p.i. from cells infected with DENV and treated with DMSO or inhibitors. Viral infection was detected by performing Western blot analysis for DENV NS3. The levels of NS3 were reduced in cells treated with all three inhibitors compared to DMSO treatment, suggesting that the inhibitors act at a stage prior to viral protein translation (Fig. 3a) . We next determined the DENV genome levels at 24 h p.i. by real-time PCR in total RNA isolated from DENV-infected cells treated with DMSO or inhibitors and found that DENV RNA levels were reduced by over 80% by all three inhibitors (Fig. 3b) . As the inhibitors were added after virus entry into the cells in all the experiments, inhibition is likely to be occurring at the stage of either viral uncoating, translation of the viral RNA from the input virus, or RNA replication.",
