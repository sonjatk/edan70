    "text": "Finally, in order to provide a global perspective of the molecular evolution of H5N1_NA, the dataset of 909 sequences of Influenza A viruses rather than H5N1 alone has been utilized. The objective of this macro level analysis is to signify the fact that this approach may lead to the nearest neighbors of some of the lethal clades which may be kept under observation for further evolution. Again, the large dataset was analyzed using the three algorithms ProtPars, NJ and UPGMA. The results obtained are shown in the additional files 11, 12, and 13. As per the core and medium sized datasets, the macro dataset also conforms Distributed ML Workflow Distance-based Parsimony to the clustering of H5N1_NA along the spatial lines rather than temporal or host range lines.",
