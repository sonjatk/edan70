    "text": "In KD subjects, a polyclonal antibody response against endothelial cells has been described [124] . Cytokines, such as IFN-Î³, IL-1 and TNF, that would be present during generalized inflammation, facilitate a pathological anti-endothelial response of circulating IgG and IgM antibodies associated with acute KD [125, 126] . In cell lysis assays, pathogenesis was eliminated by clearing the serum through anti-IgG and anti-IgM sepharose columns supportive of no role of peripheral anti-IgA responses. This does not eliminate the potential role of intra-tissue IgA+ plasma cell development in pathogenesis as has been postulated [83, 102] . Other studies support significant IgM mediated cytotoxicity against endothelial cells in KD patients [127] . Prevalent IgM anti-endothelial responses in KD have also been shown without cytokine stimulation [127, 128] . In a mouse model system, anti-endothelial antibody responses were replicated, but these did not demonstrate cardiac vascular involvement [129] . The case report of anti-B cell monoclonal antibody success was proposed by the authors to be due to the downregulation of such an anti-endothelial invasive effect [63] . Although intriguing, it remains unknown if these anti-endothelial responses actually contribute to the vasculitis in KD and other vasculitides [123] .",
