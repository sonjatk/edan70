    "text": "This point is further illustrated by the ratio of percenttranscytosed:percent-infectious virus ( Figure 3E ). For example, for every infectious unit, about 30 times more virus is transcytosed with VRC01 than with HIVIG ( Figure 3E ). Note that independently of transcytosis, HIV-1 JRLF infectivity on TZM-bl cells increased about 3.5-fold after incubation of virus for 12 hours at pH 6.0 compared with pH 7.4; however, IC 50s were very similar (,15% difference) at the two pH values (pH comparisons done for 2F5 and VRC01 only; data not shown). Virus infectivity was essentially abrogated after a 12-hour incubation at pH 4.0 (data not shown).",
