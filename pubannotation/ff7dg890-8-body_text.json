    "text": "The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in the significance attached to infectious diseases from the public health perspective. This trend is due in part to the emergence of new and highly pathogenic infections such as Ebola [1] , West Nile virus [2] , and SARS [3] . There are also wellpublicized concerns surrounding the deliberate introduction of pathogens as bioterrorism weapons [4, 5] , and the continued persistence and resurgence of older infections, several of which now boast strains resistant to more than one drug [6] . In addition, there have been a number of high-profile and economically expensive disease outbreaks in domestic livestock [7] [8] [9] as well as wildlife populations [10] .",
