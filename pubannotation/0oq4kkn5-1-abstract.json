    "text": "Supplementary Figure 1: Inhibition of the protease in the FRET-based enzyme activity assay at various concentrations of 1 and 2 in the same ratio as in the ligation assay. Supplementary Figure 2: The LC chromatogram of the ligation of 1 and 2 in different solvents and with or without enzyme present, clearly shows that multiple outcomes of the ligation process are possible and highly depend on the reaction conditions. Supplementary Figure 12: 1 H-and 13 C-NMR spectrum of 8 Supplementary Figure 29: RP-HPLC chromatogram of 21 Supplementary Figure 30: Deconvoluted ESI-MS spectrum of CVB3 3C Pro HPLC-ESI-MS spectra were recorded with an Agilent 1100 LC/MS system equipped with a Luna-C18, 3 µm by Phenomenex. A gradient of water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) was used and each solvent contained 0.1% (vol/vol) formic acid. During the analysis the the solvent ratio (A:B) was changed from 95:5 to 1:99, while maintaining a flowrate of 1 ml/min. Mass spectrometry with 3C Pro -C147A mutant 20 µL of a 0.425 µg/ml enzyme solution (containing also 100 mM Tris*HCl, 200 mM NaCl, 4 mM EDTA, 20% glycerine) were incubated with 250 µM inhibitor for 60 minutes.",
