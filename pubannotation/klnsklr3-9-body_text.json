    "text": "Given that LDV is a single-stranded RNA virus, we investigated whether the pDC-dependent IFNa response was mediated by toll like receptor 7 (TLR7), which is highly expressed by pDC's, binds to single stranded viral RNA, and is capable of initiating IFNa responses in pDC's without their direct infection [28] . Mice containing a genetically inactivated TLR7 gene [29, 30] failed to mount IFNa responses or to upregulate CD69 expression in response to LDV infection, whereas genetically matched TLR7 wild type mice showed strong IFNa responses and CD69 upregulation ( Figure 4A, B) . Consistent with the results from pDC depletions, LDV plasma titers were again not significantly different in the absence of TLR7 expression and IFNa production ( Figure 4C ). These results are similar to data from type I interferon receptor-deficient mice infected with LDV, although that study noted slight (two fold) increases in virus titers in the absence of type I interferon signaling [31] .",
