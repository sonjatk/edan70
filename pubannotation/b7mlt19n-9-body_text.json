    "text": "We have previously identified all the verified and putative LIR motifs in eukaryotic model organisms. 28 We also compared the enrichment of putative LIR motifs in viruses infecting some of the model organisms (human, mouse, rat, and chicken) (Table S3) . Two hypergeometric tests have been conducted to compare the enrichment fold of LIRCPs in viruses against the host: one for proteins containing all combination of LIR patterns (i.e., either xLIR or WxxL, or both kind) and another considering only the proteins containing at least one xLIR motif (i.e., xLIR patterns alone or along with one or more WxxL patterns). We observed that when all the possible combinations of LIR patterns are taken into account, there is an enrichment of putative LIR motifs in viruses compared with the host organism for all 4 model organisms tested. However, there is an enrichment of xLIR patterns in the host compared with the infecting viruses.",
