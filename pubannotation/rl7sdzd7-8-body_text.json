    "text": "Even though the insertions of the transgenes have different breakpoints from the plasmids, they are very close so it was possible to design assays for the RF3 and MS8 events utilizing a common set of primers within the transgenes ( Figure 1 ). When used in conjunction with primers for the plant sequence at the border of each event, they are able to detect each event ( Figure 2 ). Since they have 50% of primers in common, it was important to determine whether there was any cross reaction between the assays. Specificity of the two assays was tested using plasmid DNA for each event. No cross-reaction between the two targets was observed ( Figure 2 ).",
