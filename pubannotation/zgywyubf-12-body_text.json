    "text": "Proteasomal degradation of IκBα is preceded by its ubiquitination, which occurs by the association of phosphorylated IκBα with the SCF βTRCP complex [14] . In order to check whether ORF2 inhibits IκBα ubiquitination, we checked the level of ubiquitinated IκBα in ORF2 expressing cells. Mock or ORF2 transfected cells were treated with MG-132 for 2 hours, IκBα was immunoprecipitated, followed by immunblotting with anti-ubiquitin antibody. Protein level of ubiquitinated IκBα was significantly decreased in full-length ORF2 expressing cells as compared to control cells ( Figure 3A top panel, lane 1 and 2) . A similar effect (lane 3) was observed following expression of a mutant ORF2 protein (Δ35) with ER signal sequence deleted which consequently constitutively localizes to the cytoplasm [15] . Aliquots of the immunoprecipitated lysate were immunoblotted with IκBα antibody to confirm its presence ( Figure 3A , middle panel). A parallel set of samples were labeled with [ 35 S]-cys/met promix, immunoprecipitated with anti-ORF2 antibody and autoradiographed to check the expression of full-length and Δ35 ORF2 protein ( Figure 3A, bottom panel) .",
