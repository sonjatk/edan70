    "text": "Infection triggers a cascading host response that is highly orchestrated by the vertebrate immune system. Many genes are modulated (expressed or repressed) during the course of infection and identification of mRNA and noncoding RNAs can be used to identify the mechanisms that control, or fail to control, disease. Moreover, some infectious diseases, including hantavirus disease, have substantial immunopathologic components. The quantitative assessment of the transcriptional landscape (patterns of gene expression) can be used to profile the host responses in infected and uninfected animals of the same species, or a disease model species to reservoir host species to identify mechanisms of susceptibility or resistance. RNA-Seq is one such method for profiling transcriptional landscapes [89] . The depth of coverage and costs of RNA-Seq have improved dramatically in the last few years, and it is likely to become less expensive. However, the computational resources necessary for using RNA-Seq for studying host responses is substantial, often requiring hundreds of gigabytes of RAM and multicore, multiprocessor systems typically found in servers running a Linux operating system [90] . This depth is often necessary to detect RNAs that occur in extremely low abundance because their proteins are highly potent (e.g., cytokines). Even then, it is possible that differentially expressed genes may not be detected and other, more sensitive methods, such as real-time PCR, may be required to validate pathway signatures. Despite these requirements, bioinformatics tools for RNA-Seq are now widely available, many of which are free. A typical first step of differential gene expression profiling is the de novo assembly of all RNA-Seq samples from an experiment, which represents the totality of expressed genes from the experiment. There are several de novo assemblers available, including the Trinity suite [90] and Oases [91] . Each of these packages has advantages and disadvantages, thus it is important to understand how each performs assemblies, particularly isoforms that may have specific activities. Included in the Trinity package is RSEM [92] that estimates transcript abundances, including isoforms, in experimental samples by counting reads from replicates against the de novo assembly. An important feature of RSEM is that it does not require an annotated genome; it determines the abundance of transcripts from the unannotated assembly, identifies differentially expressed transcripts, and provides a 95% credibility interval for each gene. Additional tools, such as DESeq and edgeR [93, 94] provide statistical evaluation of differential gene expression between samples and provide quantitative (higher/lower) and qualitative (on/off) data. The differentially expressed transcripts are subsequently identified by other means (e.g., BLAST) and can then be mapped to pathways (such as Reactome or KEGG) [95, 96] to visualize [97] where viruses may influence the host response and identify mechanistic targets of hantaviruses.",
