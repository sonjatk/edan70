    "text": "Similar to previous reports, we found a relatively high prevalence of cats that were positive for FCoV antibody and C. perfringens enterotoxin gene (15) . Cats with a positive status were included within this study population, receiving dietary intervention alone. Similar to a previous report (15) , a positive status did not correlate with the occurrence of vomiting or diarrhea over the study period. It should be emphasized that the presence of FCoV antibody and C. perfringens toxin gene does not necessarily denote infection nor does it indicate the need to initiate medical therapy. Similarly, antimicrobial therapy for Campylobacter spp. is not recommended in animals that are not immunocompromised or showing systemic signs of illness (fever, hemorrhagic diarrhea, abnormal leukogram findings) as it can prolong the carrier state and the diarrhea typically selfresolves with supportive care alone (16) .",
