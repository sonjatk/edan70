    "text": "The present paper analyzes 603 consecutive visits for asthma exacerbations in our Pediatric ED. The proportion of visits for asthma that we describe (2.6%) is similar to that reported by Nath and Hsia in 2015 in a United States study (2.8%) [9] . According to what is described by Bekmezian et al. [10] , most patients were males and preschool-aged children. \"Green\" and \"yellow\" triage priority labels were the most frequently assigned to our patients; the severity was most often judged as mild or moderate and only in 4% of the patients as severe. Bekmezian et al. studied 1249 Pediatric ED visits for moderate-to-severe asthma exacerbations and reported that only 1% of them had a triage priority code \"1\" (comparable to our \"red\"); in most cases, a \"2\" or \"3\" code was assigned and, less frequently, a \"4 or 5\" code [10] .",
