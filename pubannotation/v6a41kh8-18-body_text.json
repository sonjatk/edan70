    "text": "The data were double entered and compared on a daily basis using Microsoft Visual FoxPro version 6.0 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). Statistical analyses were performed using Stata/MP 10.0 for Macintosh (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). The 95% confidence intervals (CI) for proportions were calculated with binominal exact confidence interval using the 'ci' command. Of the children included in this analysis, 274 were enrolled twice and 18 thrice. We used the 'cluster' option in Stata to adjust the confidence intervals of the proportions for repeated enrollments and thus allowed for possible dependence of observations in a child that was included more than once. Anthropometric measures were expressed as Z-scores, which were generated using the WHO Child Growth Standards 2005 [23] . Meteorological data for the Kathmandu airport weather station (located approximately 10 km from Bhaktapur) were obtained from Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology, Kathmandu, Nepal. Mean daily values for relative humidity and temperature were calculated as the average of two daily measurements (relative humidity at 8.45 AM and 5.45 PM, and maximum and minimum temperature). We estimated the Spearman rank order correlation coefficient to describe the association between the monthly number of infections with each virus and meteorological factors.",
