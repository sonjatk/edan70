    "text": "We declare evidence of an outbreak signature (test positive), at time t if the observed detection value D k,t is larger than a given threshold. For a fixed value of α, let 1 -α denote the specificity (the probability of a true-negative). Similarly, the sensitivity is defined to be the probability of true positive. The threshold, τ k,α , is chosen by solving P (D k,t > τ k,α ) = α for τ k,α . Either we can estimate this value from the data using the 1 -α quantile of the {D k,t } process of non-outbreak-based training data, or if {X k,t } is Gaussian then for large m,",
