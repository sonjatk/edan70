    "text": "An analytical method using HPLC with ultraviolet detection was developed for the quantification of lycorine in extracts of different parts of wild plant and tissue culture samples of H. littoralis. The method was found to be accurate and repeatable and sensitive for the quantification of minute amount of lycorine present in the samples. The highest lycorine content in the wild plants was found in the bulb extract, whereas the least was in the root extract. Callus culture samples of H. littoralis had comparable lycorine content to that of wild plants. The results showed that 4.5 M 2,4-D alone or a combination of 9.00 M with 4.5 M BAP was the optimum concentrations for the production of high lycorine content in callus culture.",
