    "text": "Polyamines are small, positively-charged molecules that are abundant in eukaryotic cells. Polyamines function in nucleotide metabolism, cell cycling, and cell signaling, among several other functions [16] [17] [18] . Several compounds have been developed that specifically target polyamine metabolism, either by reducing their synthesis or enhancing their breakdown, and these compounds have been tested clinically for the treatment of cancers and parasites [19] [20] [21] . Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), which inhibits polyamine biosynthesis, has received attention as an anti-trypanosomal molecule and is well-tolerated in patients [22, 23] . Polyamines are also crucial for RNA virus infection, including CVB3 [24]. Polyamine depletion via DFMO restricts CVB3 infection, in vitro and in vivo [25]. We previously described how Chikungunya and Zika viruses rely on polyamines for viral translation and genome replication [26] ; however, whether similar processes are affected for other viruses and precisely how polyamines function during CVB3 replication remain to be completely understood.",
