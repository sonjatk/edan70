    "text": "These recent structural and biochemical studies complement in vivo studies of the USP-46/WDR-48/WDR-20 complex in C. elegans. Dahlberg and Juo (2014) showed that the C. elegans homologs of WDR48 and WDR20 form a stable ternary complex with USP-46 in HEK293T cells. Consistent with prior studies (Cohn et al., 2009; Kee et al., 2010; Faesen et al., 2011) , full activation of C. elegans USP-46 catalytic activity in vitro requires both WDR48 and WDR20 (Dahlberg and Juo, 2014) . In contrast to the increased degradation of GLR-1 observed in usp-46 loss-of-function mutants (Kowalski et al., 2011) , overexpression of usp-46 in neurons does not stabilize GLR-1 (Dahlberg and Juo, 2014) . However, co-expression of WDR-48 and WDR-20 in neurons did increase surface and total levels of GLR-1 as well as glutamate-dependent behavior in an usp-46-dependent manner. These data suggest that endogenous WDR-48 and WDR-20 may be limiting in vivo. Together with data showing that co-expression of the USP-46/WDR-48/WDR-20 complex reduces levels of ubiquitinated GLR-1 (Dahlberg and Juo, 2014) , these results support a model wherein USP-46, when bound to WDR-48 and WDR-20, deubiquitinates GLR-1 and increases receptor stability and function in vivo.",
