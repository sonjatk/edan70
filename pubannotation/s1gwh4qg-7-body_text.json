    "text": "The problem of ID-to-name conversion has been partially addressed in the NEXUS alignment format [24] , which has a reserved part (block) for converting names in a predefined manner, and in the stand-alone tool Phyutility [25] that allows combining a limited number of GenBank characteristics with a custom separator to form sequence names. Here we introduce a dedicated web tool dubbed Sequence Name Annotation-based Designer (SNAD) that provides a versatile facility with user-friendly interface for automatic conversion of sequence UIDs into biologically informative names and acronyms in controllable manner using annotation associated with sequences. Several examples are provided to illustrate how SNAD can be used to generate names for practical purposes, particularly in virology. Implementation SNAD (ver. 1.6) is accessible at http://veb.lumc.nl/SNAD. SNAD code is written in Perl (BioPerl for dynamic retrieval of entries from databases, CGI for interfacing Perl code with web server, original Perl code for analysis of sequence objects retrieved from databases, and conversion of sequence annotation into complex names, part of application programming interface -API), JavaScript (graphical user interface for uploading data, designing format of name conversion and representing results), Java (part of API) and HTML for SNAD web site pages (see http://veb.lumc.nl/SNAD where a detailed description of all SNAD options and parameters can be found). SNAD can be used as a web server with APIs in Perl and Java available on SNAD web site. SNAD recognizes input as alignment or tree with the use of BioPerl drivers (Bio::TreeIO and Bio::AlignIO). If the input is not recognized as alignment or tree, SNAD processes it as a list of identifiers separated by one or more of the following symbols: space, new line, tabulator, or comma. To map IDs on database entries, Bio::DB::(GenBank, SwissProt, EMBL or SeqHound) drivers and Bio::EnsEMBL::DBSQL::DBAdaptor are used. SNAD uses standard BioPerl functions from Bio::Seq for extracting features/annotation from the database entries (GenBank/RefSeq/GenPept, UniProt, EMBL, SeqHound) or functions from database programming interface (EnsEMBL). Detailed description of all available functions is presented in \"Introduction\" page of the web site. SNAD code is available for downloading by noncommercial users per request sent to SNAD@lumc.nl.",
