    "text": "Initial T cell activation of both virus-and myelin-specific CD4 + T cells occurs within CLN (13, 29) , consistent with anatomical linkage between deep CLN and CNS by the meningeal lymphatic system (30) . Transfer of Foxp3 + Tregs during acute JHMV infection limited CNS tissue damage by inhibiting T cell proliferation within CLN and reducing overall T cell numbers within the CNS, yet without affecting frequencies of virus-specific T cells (20) . These studies predicted that Foxp3 + Treg depletion during chronic JHMV infection would increase T cell numbers in CLN and CNS. DT-treated DTR + mice indeed exhibited a threefold increase in CLN cellularity compared to DTR − controls between days 21 and 28 p.i. (Figure 2A) . However, overall CD4 + and CD8 + T cell proportions were not altered suggesting the cellular increase was not lymphocyte specific ( Figure 2B) . Analysis of T cell activation following Treg depletion revealed a significant increase in CD62L low CD44 hi populations in both the CD4 + and CD8 + T cell subset ( Figure 2C ). Contrasting increased activation in CLN, DTR − and DTR + mice showed no difference in total numbers of splenocytes 1 week after DT treatment (data not shown), suggesting specific regulation in CLN.",
