    "text": "Subsequently, we checked whether ORF2 interfered with the assembly of IκBα ubiquitination machinery. Expression of ORF2 protein inhibited the association of IκBα with SKP1 ( Figure 3B Since the presence of ORF2 could inhibit IκBα association with full-length βTRCP but not with ΔF-βTRCP, we postulated that the ORF2 protein either interacts with IκBα and sequesters it away from βTRCP or interacts with other subunits of the SCF complex thereby modulating βTRCP binding to IκBα. Alternatively, it binds to βTRCP itself and blocks the formation of the SCF complex. We thus checked the association of ORF2 with the above components. No interaction was detected between ORF2 and IκBα ( Figure 3C , lane 6) as judged by coimmunoprecipitation assay. The possibility that βTRCP over-expression might be promoting ORF2 association with IκBα was ruled out by testing ORF2 and IκBα association in full-length or ΔF-βTRCP overexpressing cells ( Figure 3D, lane 7 and 8 ). Lane 1 shows the level of IκBα in control cells. Subsequently, we checked whether ORF2 interacts with SKP1 and CUL1. The ORF2 protein did not associate with either SKP1 or CUL1 ( Figure 3D, lane 1 and 2) under conditions, where IKBα associated with these proteins (lane 3).",
