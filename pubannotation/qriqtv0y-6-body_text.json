    "text": "Canine Kobuvirus (CaKoV) is an emerging pathogen in Thailand. To the best of our knowledge, the CaKoV was described in Asia in retrospective study in Korea in 2011 and have been reported in Japan, China and Australia, respectively [2, 15, 17, 21] . However, the CaKoV have never been reported in the country or South East Asia region. In this study, during the 2 year-survey program, we found CaKoV positivity at 17.59% in both sick (19.44%) and healthy (9.09%) animals. Compare to other studies, CaKoV % positivity in this study was lower than those in China (54%) and Korea (32.2%) [14, 22] . Our result showed that the CaKoV could be frequently detected in younger dogs at 27% which consistence with previous reports [15] . Similar to other previous studies, co-infections with other enteric viral pathogens were observed such as CaKoV/Canine parvovirus and CaKoV/ Canine Coronavirus [12, 14, 15] . Moreover, CaKoVs were detected in both diarrheic and non-diarrheic dogs which consistent with other studies [2, 15] . Our result supported that this virus may not be the only cause of enteric disease in dogs. Nevertheless, the CaKoV infection have still been identified in symptomatic dogs without other enteric pathogen infections [12] . Our observation supported that the role of CaKoV as a primary pathogen of acute gastroenteritis remain unclear.",
