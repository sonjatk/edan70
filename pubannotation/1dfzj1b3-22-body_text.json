    "text": "3.1.1. Peroxidation level evaluation using the ferric thiocyanate During linoleic acid oxidation, peroxides are formed (primary products of oxidation), which oxidise Fe 2+ to Fe 3+ . The latter ions form a complex with thiocyanate, and this complex has a maximum absorbance at 500 nm. Therefore, high absorbance indicates high linoleic-acid oxidation. Using this method, some authors [42] found that Lavandula angustifolia Mill. oil from Australia was significantly more effective against lipid peroxidation than any of the other oils studied. Such oil was predominantly constituted by linalool and lynalyl acetate.",
