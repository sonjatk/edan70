    "text": "Cancer claims over half a million lives in the United States annually, and lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer death in both men and women. An estimated 226,160 new cases of lung cancer was diagnosed in 2012 in the United States alone, and 160,340 lung cancer deaths are estimated to occur [1] . Chronic inflammation has been associated with an increased risk of cancer. Protein levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a mediator of inflammation, were reported elevated in several cancer types, including colorectal, prostate, and lung cancers, and suppression of either COX-2 expression or COX-2 activation, is being considered for cancer prevention and therapy [2] . Of the five prostaglandins (PG) produced by COX-2, PGE 2 appeared to play essential roles in tumor cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression [3] [4] [5] . Four receptor subtypes are known to bind PGE 2 , and they are named EP1-4. These receptors have also been implicated in tumor cell growth and progression [6, 7] . PGE 2 is increased in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease also showing a higher incidence of lung cancer [8] .",
