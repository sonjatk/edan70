    "text": "We observed one distinct hMPV epidemic, which peaked between December 2004 and January 2005. The epidemic lasted from July 2004 to January 2005 and comprised 70% of the hMPV isolates detected during the entire 3year study period. Substantial variation in the yearly incidence of hMPV has also been reported earlier [43, 44] . Epidemics with this virus have been reported to occur during late winter to spring in temperate climates [33, 45] , including North India [46] , where the majority of hMPV were detected from December to February, and Korea [45] , where hMPV peaked between February and April. A study in subtropical Hong Kong found hMPV infections mainly in the spring and summer months [47] , similar to that of RSV [48] and occasionally influenza [49] .",
