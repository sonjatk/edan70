    "text": "The input can be either copy-pasted or uploaded from a file. SNAD accepts IDs from five databases (Table 1) including GenBank (gi or accession number) and UniProt (accession number or entry name) that are automatically recognized in and extracted from the input data prepared in several formats: as part of tree ('newick' and 'nexus') and alignment ('fasta', 'msf', 'clustalw', 'nexus', 'phylip', 'mega' and 'stockholm') or supplied as a plain list ( Figure  2 ). Examples of IDs, unique and non-unique, in alignment, tree, and plain list are available for testing purposes. SNAD may accept input with non-unique IDs, e.g. Gen-Bank accession number or locus name, that are most popular among researchers. Since these IDs may be associated with multiple entries, SNAD must decide which entry is to be used to retrieve annotation. The adopted approach is to use the most recent entry that might be not the one the user aimed at to retrieve annotation. The user may request automatically generated ID-to-name log (see below) for checking the quality of the conversion. To ensure unequivocal ID processing the user must use UIDs in input. UIDs from one database can be used to query another non-cognate database in which it may be not recognized at all or recognized as non-unique IDs ( The user has a choice of reading SNAD output either on the \"Execution\" web page, or at a separate web page in plain text mode, or receiving it via e-mail. For tree input, SNAD generates, additionally to the standard output, a respective tree drawn to facilitate visual inspection of the generated names in graphic format. The web page output can be enhanced with links to cognate entries accessible through the generated names.",
