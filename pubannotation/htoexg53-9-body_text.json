    "text": "Recombinant MVA was generated using standard methodology as described previously [45] . Briefly, monolayers of nearly confluent CEF grown in six-well tissue culture plates (Sarstedt, NÃ¼rnbrecht, Germany) were infected with non-recombinant MVA (clonal isolate MVA F6) at 0.05 multiplicity of infection (MOI) and, 45 min after infection, CEF cells were transfected with plasmid pIIIH5red-MERS-N DNA using X-tremeGENE DNA Transfection Reagent Lipofectamine (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) as recommended by the manufacturer. At 48 h after infection, the cell cultures were harvested and recombinant MVA expressing the MERS-CoV N protein was clonally isolated by consecutive rounds of plaque purification in CEF by screening for transient co-expression of the red fluorescent marker protein mCherry.",
