    "text": "Several experiments suggest that USP46 loss-offunction affects the GABAergic system. First, hippocampal immunohistochemistry showed reduced expression of the GABA synthesis enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67) in USP46 ( K92) mutants (Tomida et al., 2009) , suggesting that USP46 may regulate GABA synthesis. Second, muscimol-induced postsynaptic GABA A receptor currents were slightly reduced in hippocampal neurons of USP46 ( K92) mutants. This effect may be mediated by extrasynaptic GABA A receptors since no alterations were observed in mIPSC amplitude or frequency (Tomida et al., 2009) . Third, administration of the GABA A receptor agonist, nitrazepam, restores depression-like behavior in USP46 ( K92) and KO mutant mice, and these effects could be blocked by the GABA A receptor antagonist flumazenil (Imai et al., 2012) . Together, these data suggest that USP46 affects both preand postsynaptic components of the GABA system, however the precise mechanism is not known. One possibility is that USP46 may indirectly affect the GABA system as a compensatory response to a primary defect in AMPAR degradation in excitatory neurons. It will be important in the future to test if USP46 functions in GABA neurons and whether it directly deubiquitinates components of the GABA system.",
