    "text": "The finding that IgG from cervicovaginal and seminal fluids obtained from HIV-infected individuals mediate enhanced transcytosis of infectious virus further suggests the biological relevance of our results. Cervicovaginal and seminal fluids are reported to contain an average of ,3 mg/ml and up to ,15 mg/ ml of Env-specific IgG [18] . Four of the six samples we evaluated bound to infectious HIV-1 at 5 mg/ml. Moreover, all of our samples mediated transcytosis at #12.5 mg/ml of total IgG, well below total IgG concentrations found in genital secretions of HIVinfected men and women [18] . Even during acute HIV infection, when the risk of transmission to an uninfected partner is highest, 23 of 23 subjects (100%) were reported to have anti-gp41 IgG antibodies and 40% had anti-gp120 IgG antibodies in cervicovaginal and seminal fluids [17] . Anti-gp41 IgG levels were on average 11-fold higher than gp41-specific IgA levels; anti-gp41 IgM was found less frequently and in lower quantity. Thus, HIV-1 immune complexes are likely to occur in mucosal secretions, are likely to contain predominantly IgG, and under acidic conditions, would be subject to FcRn-mediated transcytosis in an exposed host.",
