    "text": "Among all 10,451 genome positions sequenced, 243 positions contained more than one consensus nucleotide across the samples, and 4 of these positions showed 3 different consensus nucleotides across the samples. These consensus-level variations across the samples occurred in all five genes of the rabies genome as well as four intergenic regions (Fig. S2 ). The intergenic regions tended have higher rates of consensus-level mutations compared to the 5 genes, with the region between G and L being the most variable (0.06 mutations per nucleotide, Table 1 The intergenic region between G and L remained the most variable, followed by the intergenic region between P and M. The M protein had the highest rate of consensus-level variation across all samples, but the G protein had the highest rate of consensuslevel variation in the outbreak samples.",
