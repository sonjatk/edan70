    "text": "The Seqboot component is modified to break up its output file's data into several data sets, which are written to a buffered output port. Distribution of files is then implemented by using a demultiplexer (Demux) component and a result combining module (Concat). More technical details about the file distribution and concatenation as well as other workflow parameters can be found elsewhere [23] . The model, design and implementation used to distribute the distance-based workflow can also be applied to parallelize the parsimony and the ML based workflows. The usage of the model and design developed for the Protdist component has therefore been used for the Protpars and the ProtML components. The corresponding workflows are shown in Figure 1 , 2, and 3. Figure 9 Distance based Quascade workflow. Screenshot of sequential distance based phylogenetic analysis workflow in Quascade.",
