    "text": "Respiratory viruses, and especially RSV, are leading causes of hospitalization in infants and young children during the cold season in temperate climates [4, 5] . Studies in the 1980s highlighted the importance of viruses in LRTI and identified RSV as the predominant cause in children aged <5 years also in developing countries [6] . This was confirmed in a WHO-sponsored denominator-based study of RSV-associated LRTI in four developing countries [7] . Moreover, while influenza virus is being recognized as causing severe LRTI in otherwise healthy children in highincome countries [8] , little information on its epidemiology is available from resource-poor settings. A few studies on the more recently discovered hMPV have been published, but these studies were small and covered varying seasons and age groups [9] [10] [11] . Seasonality of RSV and influenza in tropical and sub-tropical regions differs from the well-defined seasonal outbreaks seen in temperate climates, and the seasonal pattern of these infections in developing countries varies considerably between regions [1, 12] . Knowledge of the local epidemiology of these infections is essential for predicting epidemics and planning preventive measures, such as development and introduction of vaccines in low-and middle-income countries.",
