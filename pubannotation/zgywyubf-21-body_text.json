    "text": "Hence it is worth speculating that the ORF2 βTRCP interaction would occur in the cytoplasm. Although ORF2 is an N-linked glycoprotein, which is cotranslationally translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum, recent studies performed in our laboratory have demonstrated that a fraction of ORF2 protein exploits the ER retro-translocation machinery to get access to the cytoplasm, where it is detected as a non-glycosylated protein. Importantly, in contrast to other retrotranslocated substrates, retrotranslocated ORF2 protein is not immediately degraded by the 26S proteasome complex present in the cytoplasm [16] . Thus, cytoplasm localized deglycosylated ORF2 protein may be able to associate with βTRCP. Indeed, experiments done using Δ35 ORF2 protein suggest that non-glycosylated, cytoplasm localized ORF2 protein is capable of associating with βTRCP and inhibiting NF-κB activity. Further studies need to be undertaken to verify the exact mechanism.",
