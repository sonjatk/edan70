    "text": "A likely candidate underlying the Chr2: 77.5 6 1 Mb eQTL is the Ttn gene, encoding TTN, a giant muscle structural protein which acts as a myofibrillar backbone attached to the Z-disk, the thin filament, the thick filament, and the M-band (Linke 2008) . TTN regulates the passive stretch of cardiomyocytes via the I-band region of the protein which is comprised of sequential Ig, PEVK, and N2B domains (Linke 2008) . In the heart, alternative splicing of Ttn results in a shorter ventricular isoform (N2B) and a longer atrial isoform (N2BA) . These two isoforms are coexpressed at different ratios during development as a mechanism for fine-tuning the passive stiffness of the cardiomyocyte . TTN acts as a signaling hub from which direct and indirect interactions with multiple proteins can lead to diverse cellular responses, including changes in gene expression (Linke 2008) .",
