    "text": "Fragment analysis was performed on a GenomeLab GeXP fragment analysis system (Beckman Coulter Inc.) 1µL of PCR product was dissolved in 39µL of sample loading solution and 400 bp DNA ladder was used as size reference. The Kan-r PCR fragment and RP DNA along with RP RNA PCR fragment were used as reaction control and sample control respectively. If control bands were absent, the analysis was repeated to rule out procedural errors. Viral target identification was performed using GenomeLab GexP fragment analysis software.",
