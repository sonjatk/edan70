    "text": "The PDK1 gene promoter contains multiple transcription factor-binding sites, including two sites for c-Jun. Then we explored the role of c-Jun in mediating PGE 2induced PDK1 expression in normal bronchial epithelial cells. PGE 2 induces the expression of c-Jun protein in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3a) . C-Jun reached its peaks at 2 h in BEAS2B cells and 4 h in HBEc14-KT cells with the concentration of 1 μM of dmPGE 2 , compared to the control group (2.561 ± 0.189 vs 1.000 ± 0.063 in BEAS2B, P <0.01; 1.347 ± 0.132 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.01). c-Jun reached its peak with the concentration of 1 μM of dmPGE 2 after incubation for 4 h, compared to the control group (1.499 ± 0.108 vs 1.001 ± 0.063 in BEAS2B, P <0.01; 1.536 ± 0.174 vs 1.000 ± 0.024 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.01). Silencing of c-Jun with its siRNA decreases cell proliferation (1.115 ± 0.054 vs 1.386 ± 0.072 in BEAS2B, P <0.05; 1.030 ± 0.104 vs 1.495 ± 0.072 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.01) (Fig. 3b) and (See figure on previous page.) Fig. 1 The effect of dmPGE 2 on human bronchial epithelial cell proliferation and induction of expression and activation of PDK1. a Effects on cell proliferation. b dmPGE 2 increases the phosphorylation and expression of PDK1 in a time-and dose-dependent manner in BEAS2B and HBEc14-KT cells. c PDK1 inhibitor OSU-03012 decreases cell proliferation induced by dmPGE 2 in normal bronchial epithelial cells. d PDK1 siRNA decreases the cell proliferation induced by dmPGE 2 in normal bronchial epithelial cells. e PDK1 plasmid increases the cell proliferation induced by dmPGE 2 in normal bronchial epithelial cells. f Effect on mRNA expression. g Effect on PDK1 promoter activity the expression of PDK1 induced by PGE 2 (1.105 ± 0.011 vs 2.534 ± 0.029 in BEAS2B, P <0.01; 1.157 ± 0.021 vs 1.892 ± 0.027 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.01) induced by dmPGE 2 (Fig. 3d) . Transfection with c-Jun plasmid increases the cell proliferation (1.741 ± 0.051 vs 1.518 ± 0.059 in BEAS2B, P <0.05; 1.772 ± 0.258 vs 1.521 ± 0.027 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.05) (Fig. 3c ) and the expression of PDK1 induced by PGE 2 (2.278 ± 0.134 vs 1.196 ± 0.095 in BEAS2B, P <0.05; 2.453 ± 0.141 vs 2.056 ± 0.163 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.05) (Fig. 3e) .",
