We compiled spatial data from the IUCN and identified 96 bat species from 10 families that are distributed in Western Asia (Table S1 ). Species richness is highly variable in the region ( Figure 2 ), with no bat species reported in Bahrain and up to 43 species reported in Iran (Table S1 ). Bat species diversity hotspots include the Mediterranean coast from Israel extending to Turkey, the Caucasus mountain region that includes Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, and northeastern Pakistan ( Figure 2 ). Conversely, arid regions have the lowest species richness, including the vast majority of Saudi Arabia, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, and Iraq. While our map provides a good approximation of bat species richness in the region, using IUCN data alone may likely represent an underestimate as many species have not been reassessed since 2008. Several new distributional records have been published in the last decade, which expands the known geographic range for some species. In other cases, estimates of species richness are lower than depicted, e.g., at least one species (i.e., Myotis hajastanicus) has been shown to be a local variant of a widespread species rather than a distinct species [102] .

Emirates; YEM-Yemen. Shapefiles of species' ranges were extracted using the package raster [105] and converted to raster files using package fasterize [106] . Rasterized polygons of species' ranges were cropped to include only Western Asian countries based on ISO 3166 two-letter codes and mapped using packages maptools [107] and viridis [108] . All analyses were conducted in R version 3.4.3 [109] .",
