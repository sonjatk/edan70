    "text": "As mentioned in Section 'Background', in the literature on hierarchical folding, there are reports of counter examples to the hierarchical folding hypothesis where bases that are initially part of the pseudoknot-free structure for a molecule later change as the pseudoknot forms. This motivates a comparison of HFold versus Iterative HFold, in order to see how a method that sticks strictly with the hypothesis (i.e., HFold) compares with a method that allows for some base changes (i.e., Iterative HFold). In Section 'Robustness comparison', we compare the robustness of HFold and Iterative HFold with respect to partial information; that is, the degree to which they provide accurate predictions as a function of how much http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/147 information about G big , the true pseudoknot-free secondary structure, is provided as input. Then in Section 'Accuracy comparison of different versions of HFold' we compare HFold, HFold-PKonly and Iterative HFold when a (possibly inaccurate) computational prediction of G big is provided as input. In Section 'Accuracy comparison with existing methods' we compare Iterative HFold-the method that performs best overall in Sections 'Robustness comparison' and 'Accuracy comparison of different versions of HFold'with existing methods for pseudoknotted secondary structure prediction. Sections 'Running time comparison' and 'Memory consumption comparison' report on the running time and memory usage of our methods.",
