    "text": "anti-FcRn antibody and inhibition of endosomal acidification by bafilomycin A1 also substantially reduced or eliminated enhanced transcytosis ( Figure S3D -F), as did competition between the non-HIV-1-specific mAb Den3 and the anti-HIV-1 Env mAb VRC01 ( Figure S3G ). Consistent with other investigations of Fc-FcRn interactions, maximally enhanced transcytosis occurred at pH 5.5-6.0, with some enhanced transcytosis apparent at pH 4.5 and 6.5 ( Figure S3H ) [38, 39] . Since FcRn binds to IgG and not to IgA, we compared two different IgG1 mAbs, b12 and HGN194, with their IgA class-switched versions. Both IgG1 mAbs enhanced transcytosis of HIV-1 JRFL pseudoviruses and SHIV 1157ipEL-p at pH 6.0, whereas the IgA class-switched versions did not ( Figure 2C and 2D). In fact, as reported, dimeric IgA1 HGN194 inhibited transcytosis [40] . Thus, enhanced transcytosis at low pH in the presence of specific antibody is mediated by IgG and is dependent on FcRn.",
