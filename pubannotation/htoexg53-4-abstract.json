    "text": "In this study, we investigated the synthesis and delivery of the MERS-CoV N protein as a privileged antigen by a MVA vector virus. The recombinant MVA expressing a synthetic gene sequence of full-length MERS-CoV N (MVA-MERS-N) proved genetically stable and fully replication-competent in chicken embryo fibroblasts, an established cell substrate for MVA vaccine manufacturing. Upon in vitro infection, MVA-MERS-N produced high amounts of the heterologous protein that were detectable with MERS-CoV N-specific antibodies. Furthermore, MVA-MERS-N was tested as an experimental vaccine in BALB/c mice and elicited MERS-CoV N-specific interferon γ (IFN-γ)-producing CD8+ T cells. Using peptide library covering the whole MERS-CoV N polypeptide, we identified new H2-d restricted peptide epitopes of MERS-CoV N in BALB/c mice. This data will be highly relevant for further assessment of N antigen-specific immune responses in the well-established MERS-CoV-BALB/c mouse immunization/challenge model [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] .",
