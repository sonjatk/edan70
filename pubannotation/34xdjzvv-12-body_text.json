    "text": "Similar scenarios were seen in the secretion of type I and type II interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brainstem, spinal cord, and muscle. Elevated IFN-a (muscle), IFN-b (brainstem, spinal cord, and muscle), and IFN-c (brainstem and muscle) responding to the innate immunity against virus infection were downregulated in transgenic mice that received N3 after infection in contrast to non-treated or isotype antibody-treated mice (Fig. 8 ). Expression of TNF-a in three tissues and IL-1b in the brainstem and muscle of transgenic mice were also suppressed significantly (Fig. 9 ). These results indicate that N3 protects mice from developing pathogenesis caused by EV71 infection. Administration of N3 did not Protect hSCARB2-transgenic Mice from Coxsackie Virus A16 Infection",
