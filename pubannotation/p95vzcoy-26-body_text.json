    "text": "The data suggest for the first time that M. rubra is another biological host for DWV type-A and -B known from honeybees and that foodborne transmission is an underlying transmission mechanism. Since ants are ubiquitous and important in terrestrial ecosystems, it appears as if there is a considerable potential for virus transmission between wild insects and managed bees with possible consequences for ecosystem functioning. It has been suggested that viruses might offer novel options for the control of invasive ant species [37] . However, we consider such biocontrol suboptimal due to the evident wide host range of viruses and the here demonstrated considerable chances of host-switches, with possibly dramatic consequences [5] .",
