    "text": "As shown in Figure 2A , Iterative HFold's average accuracy on pseudoknotted structures steadily increases from about 54% to 79% as the user provides 1% to 40% of the input structure. This improvement in accuracy slows down but still persists when further structural information is provided. If we compare the slope of the curve for Iterative HFold's average accuracy to that of HFold in Figure 2A , we can see that HFold's slope is steeper than that of Iterative HFold, making Iterative HFold more robust than HFold. For pseudoknot-free structures of the HK-PK-free data set, as shown in Figure 2B , HFold performs better than Iterative HFold. Even with 1% information about G big , HFold results in (79.76%, 84.32%) 95% bootstrap confidence interval in comparison with (79.14%, 83.84%) for Iterative HFold with the same inputs. Roughly, HFold's success for pseudoknot-free structures is because it often http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/147 adds base pairs that do not cross those provided as part of the input, and thus are likely to be in G big .",
