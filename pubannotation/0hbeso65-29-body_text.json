    "text": "Recently, accumulated data have tried to unravel the potential molecular mechanisms of HCV entry. Some fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) studies described the critical role of the association between CD81 and CLDN1 coreceptors in HCV entry [104, 105] . Next, a rate-limiting role for SR-BI in HCV infection has been reported [106] . The in vitro study demonstrated that increased SR-BI expression would enhance entry and internalization of HCV. Several studies investigating the postbinding cellular mechanisms found that the ability of HCV penetration into the hepatocytes may depend on clathrin-mediated endocytosis [107, 108] . After internalization, fusion occurs between viral and endosomal membranes. Recent assay further showed that the fusion may be low of pH and temperature dependent and facilitated by cholesterol [109, 110] . Although the detailed molecular mechanism of HCV entry still needs more investigations, it is conceivable that HCV internalization and fusion may offer many targets for the development of HCV entry inhibitors.",
