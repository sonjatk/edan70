    "text": "With regard to the initiation event that leads to the observed exacerbations of cardiorespiratory effects caused by inhaled particles, the most-recognized hypothesis is the oxidative stress paradigm. According to this hypothesis the underlying pathophysiological mechanism of particle toxicity for so called low-solubility and lowtoxicity particles (LSLTP) is dependent on particle triggered oxidative stress and subsequent inflammation [18, 19] . The most prominent feature for this innate immune response is the recruitment and activation of granulocytes, specifically neutrophils, to the site of stimulus, here the site of pulmonary particle deposition [20, 21] . For LSLTP such as titanium dioxide, polystyrene or carbonaceous nanoparticles (CNP), the particle induced pulmonary inflammatory effect, assessed as number of neutrophils accumulated in the airspace of the lungs, is predominantly driven by oxidative surface properties of the pulmonary deposited particle [22] . As consequence and due to their high specific surface area, nanoparticles have been shown to be more inflammogenic than fine particles of identical chemical composition [20, 23, 24] .",
