    "text": "N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged proteins expressed in pQE30 or pET21a were purified from Escherichia coli TG1 or BL21/DE3/pLysS cells. Single colonies were picked into Luria-Bertani broth and grown at 37 • C to an OD 600 of 0.6. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl ␤-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (to 0.1 mM) and continued for 2 h at 37 • C (or overnight at 22 • C) after which cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mM imidazole, 0.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1.4 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Tween 20, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme). Cells were incubated on ice for 30 min and sonicated to complete lysis. Protein purification was performed using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA; Qiagen) according to standard procedures (29) . Nterminally glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-tagged nsp1␤ was expressed in BL21/DE3/pLysS cells as above and purified using glutathione agarose resin (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to standard procedures (30) . Proteins were dialysed against 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.05 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and 5% glycerol, quantified by bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) and stored at −80 • C until required.",
