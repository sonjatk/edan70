    "text": "When reporting on time and memory consumption of Iterative HFold and HotKnots on the HK-PK data set, we did not include the time and memory required to get the input structures to Iterative HFold. Since we only run Hot-Knots V2.0 partially to produce hotspots it does not take as long as running HotKnots and does not consume as much memory. For example, for the 400 nucleotides long RNA sequence in our data set (A.tum.RNaseP), it only takes 0.5 seconds time and 4 MB of memory to produce the hotspots. (The time required to get the hotspots for all RNA sequences in this data set is provided in Additional file 4.) We also note that since calculating hotspots and running Iterative HFold are done sequentially, the memory consumption is calculated as the maximum of the two, so the memory consumption of Iterative HFold for this sequence is still the same even including the memory needed for calculating hotspots. As we can see based on this example, even including time and memory requirements of calculating hotspots, Iterative HFold is still faster than HotKnots and uses less memory.",
