    "text": "Previous analyses of the sources of indoor exposures have shown that outdoor air is a significant source of exposures. Therefore the second scenario was determined as an attempt to control the burden of disease by filtration the exposures originating from outdoor air. Because both ultrafine and coarse particles and chemically reactive pollutants like ozone have lower infiltration factors than PM 2.5 , dominated by accumulation mode particles, the filtration was specified for PM 2.5 particles.",
