    "text": "Fecal Consistency Scale scores were available for only 4 (31%) cats fed Diet A and 10 (67%) cats fed Diet B. The model of FCS against day and diet over the 4 weeks showed no significant differences between the diets in the change in fecal score (p > 0.05). There was no correlation between the frequency of vomiting or diarrhea over the 4-week period and the presence of fecal enteropathogens detected via PCR or antibody testing (p > 0.05). Similarly, neither Spec fPL results nor age of the cat correlated with the frequency of vomiting over the 4-week period (p > 0.05).",
