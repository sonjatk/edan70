    "text": "Permanent treatment with the DIs PR-619 and P22077 interfered with virus replication in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in a complete loss of replication capacity at 10 μM of PR-619 or 15 μM of P22077 ( Figure 4C ,E). Almost the same result was observed following structured treatment, indicating a severe block in spread of infection caused by DI treatment ( Figure 4B ,D). No delay in peak virus replication was observed indicating the inhibitory effect of PR-619 and P22077 must set in immediately after application of the drugs. ",
