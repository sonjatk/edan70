    "text": "However, transcriptional targets apart from Nostrin itself have not yet been found. LRP2 (low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2) is a critical component of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway (Christ et al. 2012) . There is some evidence that LRP2 can shed its intracellular domain, which then shuttles to the nucleus where it may interact with as-yet-unidentified transcription factors (Li et al. 2008 ). However, a role for LRP2 has not yet been identified in either heart or lung. The Chr2: 77.5 6 1 Mb region contained six genes, only two of which were expressed in adult lung (Ttn and Ccdc141; Table 3 ). Of these, titin (Ttn) was a likely candidate modifier based on its role as a key integrator of myocyte signaling pathways (Linke 2008; Miller et al. 2004) . Therefore, Rab23, Zfp451, Nostrin, Lrp2, and Ttn were analyzed further.",
