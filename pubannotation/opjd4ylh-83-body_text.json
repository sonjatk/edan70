    "text": "According to the findings of this study nurses have various unmet needs when they are doing their job. Participants expressed the need for special support from the management. They were in need of adequate supplies of specialized protective N95 masks, in-service training, workshops, proper equipment, and a daily diet for TB nurses. A study by Sodeify et al. [30] revealed that poor working conditions, lack of resources, special managerial support from the hospitals in South Africa were the reasons why nurses left South Africa to go and work abroad.",
