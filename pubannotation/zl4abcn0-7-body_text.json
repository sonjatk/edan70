    "text": "Despite many publications on the pharmacological effects of its chemical constituents, there is very little information available on the phytochemical analysis of H. littoralis wild plants or callus culture. Likewise, there is no report on the capability of callus culture of H. littoralis to produce secondary metabolites such as lycorine which has important pharmacological effects. The establishment and quantification of lycorine via in vitro propagation technique could be a first step in mass production of any desired secondary metabolites in pharmaceutical industries. Thus, in the present study, a simple HPLC with UV detection method was developed for phytochemical analysis of different parts of H. littoralis wild plants. The method was further extended for the quantification of lycorine in callus culture obtained from various combinations of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 6-benzylaminopurine concentrations.",
