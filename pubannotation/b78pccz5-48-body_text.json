    "text": "Ventilation plays a dual role in formation of indoor pollutant concentrations: on one hand it removes pollutants generated indoors from indoor spaces by ventilating the space with outdoor air, on the other hand, ventilation introduces outdoor air pollutants indoors [11, 12] . Assuming a constant outdoor pollution level and constant penetration efficiency, increasing ventilation directly leads to increased indoor exposures to outdoor pollutants. Even in the case of efficient filtering of particles in the intake air, detailed studies have shown that a substantial fraction of the outdoor air enters indoors via windows, doors, ventilation ducts, and cracks and leaks in the building envelope, leading to much lower actual filtration efficiency [13] .",
