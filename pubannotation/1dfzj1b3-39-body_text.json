    "text": "Suanarunsawat et al. (2010) [58] have investigated the anti-hyperlipidemic and antioxidant activities of essential oils extracted from Ocimum sanctum L. leaves in rats fed with high cholesterol diet. Eugenol and methyl eugenol were the most important components in the essential oils. The oils were able to decrease the high levels of TBARS either in cardiac or liver tissues, protecting them against stress induced oxidation.",
