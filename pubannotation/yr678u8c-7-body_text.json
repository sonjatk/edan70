    "text": "In addition to its role in cellular homeostasis, autophagy has been shown to have a function in innate immunity by degrading intracellular pathogens, including viruses. Furthermore, autophagy plays a role in presenting pathogen components to the immune system [22] [23] [24] [25] . Inhibition of autophagy has a positive effect on the replication or virulence of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) [26, 27] , Sindbis virus [28, 29] and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [30] . In addition, the capsid protein of Sindbis virus was found to be specifically targeted to the autophagosome via an interaction with the autophagy cargo receptor, p62 [28] . However, many viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade autophagy by inhibiting the pathway, or diverting the process to benefit virus replication. Many viral proteins have been identified that inhibit formation of autophagosomes. For example, HSV1 protein ICP34.5 binds to BECN1 and inhibits autophagosome formation and Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and murine Î³-herpesvirus (MHV-68) encode Bcl2 homologues to bind to and inhibit BECN1 [26, 31, 32] . KSHV also encodes another protein to block LC3 processing by inhibiting ATG3 [33] . Other viruses have developed mechanisms to inhibit fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encoded protein Nef interacts with BECN1, inhibiting lysosomal fusion [34] . Influenza A virus protein M2 has also been shown to induce accumulation of autophagosomes as a result of inhibition of lysosomal fusion, possibly via an interaction with BECN1 [35] . Moreover, numerous viruses have been identified which require autophagy for optimal replication, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) [36] , poliovirus [37] , coxsackievirus, HIV-1 [38] , hepatitis C virus (HCV) [39] , Dengue virus [40, 41] and Japanese encephalitis virus [42] . Finally, poliovirus subverts autophagy in order to generate membranous structures required for assembly of viral replication complexes [37, 43] . For more detailed information about the role of autophagy in the replication cycles of viruses, see reviews [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] .",
