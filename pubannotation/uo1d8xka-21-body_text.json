    "text": "In any phylogenetic analysis involving pathogenic viruses there are three clear possibilities of clustering behavior: spatial, temporal and host based. Our analysis of H5N1 NA data utilizing different phylogenetic algorithms have indicated a spatial clustering of this virus based on geographical distribution rather than temporal or host. Of course, single gene product analysis is insufficient to arrive at any biologically relevant conclusion and, hence, we propose to do multiple gene and genome level analysis as our future work. However, even for a single gene analysis the computing power required is formidable and we have used this approach as a proof of the concept that high performance computing is a must for any meaningful phyloinformatics study. Even with the limited amount of data, we have been able to find a clear pattern (geographical clustering) and the importance of glycon sites. However, further detailed studies in conjunction with other proteins such as HA, Polymerase etc., and also at gene and genome level, are required to draw firm conclusions. It is also true that interpretation becomes more difficult if the size of the trees becomes very large. In our experience, zooming onto a cluster of interest (e.g. Thailand and China clades) with relative ease and quickness, using the Quascade middleware is an attractive feature of our study. Furthermore, the comparison of different algorithms simultaneously with the same input file is another attractive attribute.",
