    "text": "Approximately 11 kb of the 12 kb rabies virus genome was amplified using degenerate primers (Table S1 ). Primers were designed to be as sensitive to target strain variants as possible, while still being specific enough to not cross-react with non-targets. Sensitivity was achieved by targeting regions of high sequence similarity, identified through a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) of the target sequences. Specificity was achieved by targeting regions that do not appear to be similar to any other organisms, determined by searching a database of known genome sequences. Primer candidates were selected based on the combined results of the MSA and sequence searches. This technique is a modified version of the approach outlined in Slezak et. al. [16] , which accommodates degenerate primer design for diverse target genomes, and places a lower relative priority on primer uniqueness as compared to other known genomes. For rabies virus, which lacks perfect primer-length conservation around the genomic regions of interest, it was necessary to identify degenerate primers for many non-conserved primer regions. From the identified primer candidate regions, which included both perfectly conserved regions and degenerate regions, individual primer pairs were selected which provided overlapping coverage of the DNA being sequenced. Final checks were performed which helped avoid hybridization problems such as primer dimerization.",
