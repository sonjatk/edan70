    "text": "Based on the apparent energy consumption data from the comprehensive energy balance table, a systematic and comprehensive city-level total carbon accounting approach was established and applied in one of the China's mega city-Guangzhou. Total carbon emissions including the fossil fuel combustion in the city's boundary and embodied in the imported electricity out of the boundary were still performing a rising tendency. Carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity played a significant important role in emissions mitigation in Guangzhou, especially after 2009. Examining the effects of different boundaries on carbon accounting at city level is crucial for the emissions mitigation in urban China.",
