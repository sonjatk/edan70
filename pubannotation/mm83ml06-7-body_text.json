    "text": "HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pNLenv1 wt. After overnight cultivation at 37 • C the cell culture supernatant was harvested and VLPs released into the supernatant were pelleted through 20% (w/v) sucrose by centrifugation (20,000× g, 4 • C, 90 min), washed with ice cold PBS, centrifuged (20,000× g, 4 • C, 90 min), lysed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) sample buffer containing 2% SDS, and boiled for 5 min. The cells were detached and washed twice in ice cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer, supplemented with 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM NEM, and protease inhibitor cocktail Complete (Roche). The samples were analyzed by western blotting. Protein bands were quantified using AIDA [54] .",
