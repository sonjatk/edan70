    "text": "Other methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures, such as the IPknot method of Sato et al. [42] , are motivated by the finding of Mathews [43] that base pairs with high base pairing probabilities in the thermodynamic ensemble are more likely to be in the known structure. In a comprehensive comparison performed by Puton et al. [44] on the performance of publicly available non-comparative RNA secondary structure prediction methods that can handle pseudoknotted structures, IPknot ranks first for general length RNA sequences.",
