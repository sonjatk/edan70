    "text": "To determine which WNV protein expression leads to overexpression of CxCul4, Hsu cells were transfected with select individual WNV genes cloned in insect vector (pIZ-V5/His). Total RNA was collected 48 hours post-transfection and real time RT-qPCR was performed using CxCul4 primers. As a control, real time RT-qPCR was performed using CxRpL32 primers. Western blot was performed on duplicate cells to confirm transfection and protein expression using anti-V5 antibody (S6 Fig). The results showed up-regulation of CxCul4 expression in cells transfected with WNV-NS1 (2 fold) and WNV-NS5 (3 fold) genes (Fig 5A) . This indicates NS1 and NS5 may be involved in upregulation of CxCul4 after WNV infection in Culex cells.",
