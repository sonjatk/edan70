    "text": "The antioxidant activity of Pistacia atlantica Desf. leaf oils from diverse origins of Algeria showed weak ability for scavenging DPPH free radicals, at least when compared to those of references (BHT and BHA). In contrast, the same oils had a higher antioxidant capacity relative to the antioxidant of reference ascobic acid when measured through the FRAP assay [78] . In the same assay, the authors also reported diverse activities depending on the harvesting place. The best activity was found in the oil obtained from Laghouat, mainly constituted by α-pinene + α-thujene, camphene and spathulenol.",
