    "text": "Pediatric asthma has different patterns according to the children's age. In the preschoolers (0-5 years old), acute wheeze is often induced by infections of the lower airways, whereas in the school-aged children (6 years and older) it usually signifies underlying asthma [6] and allergy. These differences account for specific seasonal patterns in the number of ED visits for asthma. In the temperate latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, a peak in exacerbations is described in the month of September: this well-known entity is called the \"September asthma epidemics,\" coincides with the start of the school year, and is likely due to a combination of infectious, allergic, environmental, and climatic triggers [7] . Understanding the seasonal variations of ED visits due to asthma may have important therapeutic implications in terms of a proactive treatment of at-risk subjects.",
