    "text": "These challenges emphasize the importance of chemotherapy to treat these viral infections [5] . There are around 40 antiviral compounds in clinical use targeting various viral diseases (over half of these drugs are being used in the treatment of patients with HIV infection) while there is no treatment for most acute infections, such as the ones that cause severe illnesses, including hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and even cancer [6] [7] [8] [9] . Most of the available drugs are of limited efficacy and come with severe side effects [6] . Importantly, antiviral chemotherapy is plagued by the rapid development of drug resistance strains, resulting from the high rate of replication of viruses combined with the low fidelity with which they replicate their genomes [10] .",
