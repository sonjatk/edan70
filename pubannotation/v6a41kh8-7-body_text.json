    "text": "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a novel, but now widely applied, method for the detection of respiratory viruses from clinical samples. Compared with conventional methods, PCR has significantly increased sensitivity for respiratory viral diagnosis [13, 14] and has also demonstrated high specificity [15, 16] . Viral etiology data for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) from developing countries based on molecular diagnostic methods are scarce, however, and no such studies have to our knowledge been conducted over several years and on a large number of children.",
