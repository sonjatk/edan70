    "text": "To further analyze the molecular mechanism and consequences through which MERS-CoV M protein exerts its inhibitory effect, we first investigated what signal transducer molecule might interact with the M protein. Several RLR transducers were ectopically expressed with MERS-CoV M protein in cultured cells for a coimmunoprecipitation experiment. When the transducers were precipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody, the M protein was only detected in TRAF3-containing precipitate ( Figure 4A ; lane 4 compared with lanes 1-3) even though M protein was abundantly expressed in all samples with other transducers (Figure 4A ; lower panel for input), TRAF3 functions as an adapter that bridges the mitochondrial transducer MAVS with the downstream signaling complex containing TBK1 and IKK-Îµ kinases that are essential for IRF3 activation. 34, 53 The physical association of the MERS-CoV M protein with TRAF3 ( Figure 4A ) prompted us to test whether the adapter function of TRAF3 would be particularly affected by M protein. We performed another co-immunoprecipitation experiment to explore the possibility that M protein could perturb the interaction of TRAF3 with the downstream transducer complex. When TRAF3 and TBK1 were ectopically expressed in cultured cells, the detection of TBK1 in TRAF3-immunoprecipitate confirmed the specific recruitment of TBK1 to TRAF3 in the absence of M protein ( Figure 4B ; lane 2 compared with lane 1). However, when M protein was added to the system, the interaction between TRAF3 and TBK1 was significantly disrupted ( Figure 4B ; lane 3 compared with lane 2), demonstrating that the physical association of MERS-CoV M protein with TRAF3 perturbs TRAF3-TBK1 interaction.",
