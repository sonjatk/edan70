    "text": "where I i ¼ 1 if farm i is infected and zero otherwise, and b is the transmission rate. Infected farms recover after a period T and cannot be reinfected. We aim to investigate spread of relatively 'fast-moving' diseases in the absence of movement restrictions such as FMD. We make the assumption that transmission of infection to a farm results in all animals on that farm moving into the infectious class. Given this assumption, the risk of infection between any pair of nodes in the movement network is based upon the number of movements between them rather than the number of animals moved. In order to investigate the impact of epidemiological parameters upon model predictions, we explore a range of values for the transmission parameter and the infectious period, such that b ¼ 1, 2, 5, 10 and T ¼ 7, 14, 21, 28 days.",
