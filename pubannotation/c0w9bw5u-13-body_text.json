    "text": "It was observed that MERS-CoV M protein disrupted TRAF3-TBK1 interaction ( Figure 4B ), which is required for IRF3 activation. We then evaluated whether IRF3 activation would be affected by the expression of M protein. IRF3 dimerization visualized by non-denaturing native PAGE is a sensitive assay for evaluating direct IRF3 activation. 39 Therefore, we ectopically expressed IRF3 and M protein with the inducer RIG-I N in cultured cells and subjected cell lysates directly to native PAGE to check for IRF3 dimerization. When the inducer RIG-I N was exclusively co-expressed with IRF3, the detection of an additional slow-migrating band indicated the activation and dimerization of IRF3, which would otherwise be entirely in its monomeric form in the absence of any activator ( Figure 4C ; lane 2 compared with lane 1). Interestingly, when M protein was expressed, the signal reflecting the dimeric form of IRF3 molecules was significantly diminished, even though the total IRF3 level expressed in all samples was highly comparable as detected by conventional denaturing SDS-PAGE ( Figure 4C ; lower panel for SDS-PAGE), suggesting that IRF3 activation was greatly inhibited by the MERS-CoV M protein. IRF3 phosphorylation was also suppressed with the expression of MERS M protein in a similar experimental setup ( Figure 4D ; lane 3 compared with lane 2). Together with other results, MERS-CoV M protein was thought to interact with TRAF3 to perturb TRAF3-TBK1 interaction, which, in turn, affects IRF3 phosphorylation and activation.",
