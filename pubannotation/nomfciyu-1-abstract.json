    "text": "The first case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was identified in the year 2012, which spread rapidly and increased to more than 2200 in 2018. This highly pathogenic virus with high mortality rate is among one of the major public health concerns. Saudi Arabia remains to be the most affected region with the majority of MERS-CoV cases, and currently, no effective drugs and vaccines are available for prevention and treatment. A large amount of information is now available regarding the virus, its structure, route of transmission and its pathophysiology. Therefore, this review summarizes the current understanding of MERS-CoV's pathogenesis, treatment options and recent scientific advancements in vaccine and other therapeutic developments, and the major steps taken for MERS prevention control. Coronaviruses are positive stranded RNA viruses, and while most of these infect animals, particularly bats, a minor number can also cause human diseases [16] . Human coronaviruses can be broadly divided into types, α and β coronavirus [17] . MERS-CoV is from the β-coronavirus family [18] . It has four major surface proteins that help the virus to enter the cells viz. envelope protein (E), spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein and membrane (M) protein. The spike (S) protein is a transmembrane glycoprotein made up of S1 and S2 subunits. The S protein is crucial for virus entry through binding and fusion to host cells. The S1 subunit has a receptor binding domain (RBD) that binds with the DPP4 receptor of the host [18, 19] . The S2 subunit contains heptad repeats H1 and H2 which forms the main membrane fusion unit [20] . The E protein is required for assembly, intracellular transport and budding of virus [21] . The M protein has its role in viral morphogenesis and assembly [22] . N proteins and S, E and M proteins interact to form complete virus particles [23] . In addition to these structural proteins, MERS-CoV has two large polyproteins called pp1a and pp1ab. These proteins are broken down by proteases to form various nonstructural essential proteins, such as enzymes [24, 25] . Recent studies have revealed that these viral structural and nonstructural proteins can be exploited as novel targets for therapeutic purposes [26] [27] [28] .",
