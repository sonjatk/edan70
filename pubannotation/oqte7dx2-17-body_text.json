    "text": "In the unicellular fission yeast S. pombe, the USP46 homolog Ubp9 regulates endocytosis, actin dynamics and cell polarity (Kouranti et al., 2010) . Much like its counterparts in other systems, Ubp9 is only catalytically active when bound to two WDR proteins, Bun107, which is homologous to WDR48, and Bun62, which is homologous to WDR20. Interestingly, Ubp9 stability and subcellular localization can be regulated by interaction with the WDR proteins. Kouranti et al. (2010) .",
