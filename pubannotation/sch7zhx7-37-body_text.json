    "text": "In the course of passaging CVB3 in the presence of DFMO, we observed two mutations changing from glutamine to positively charged lysine or arginine. Interestingly, we have observed such amino acid changes in our CHIKV passages [31] , in which we observed a glycine-to-arginine mutation in nsP1. Given that polyamines are positively-charged at physiological pH, the emergence of positively-charged amino acids in polyamine-depleted conditions suggests potential amino acid compensation for a loss of charge. The amino acids in which we observe mutations for CVB3 2A and 3C are not located in the active sites of either enzyme [27, 38] , suggesting that these amino acids and their associated charge may alter enzymatic activity allosterically. Precisely how positively-charged amino acids or polyamines contribute to protease activity remains unknown.",
