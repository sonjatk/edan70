    "text": "Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a member of autonomous parvoviruses in the Parvoviridae family. It appears as an icosahedral capsid that encloses a single-strand DNA genome that is 5.2 kb long. CPV replicates without the use of a helper virus and hence is called autonomous, but it utilises the machinery and components of host cells, including DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase Ι Ι for DNA replication and RNA transcription, respectively. Consequently, CPV replication is restricted to the S phase of the cell cycle 1,2 .",
