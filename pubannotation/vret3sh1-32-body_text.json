    "text": "Given a set of functional roles, one often wishes to understand which subsystems can be inferred from the set. The following example script reads as input a set of functional roles and constructs a table of subsystems that can be identified, along with their variation codes. The data displayed in this simple example could form the start of a research project to gather the functional roles not connected to subsystems to determine whether they were not connected because a small set of functional roles were not present in the input, and to seek candidates for such \"missing functional roles.\" The ability to easily map functional roles into subsystems will improve as the SEED annotation effort improves its collection of encoded subsystems [32] . The code for this example is shown at http://servers.theseed.org/sapling/server. cgi?code=server_paper_example2.pl. (also provided as Supporting Information S1).",
