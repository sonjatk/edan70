    "text": "Occupations related to pigs, breeding pigs at home, exposures to pigs or pork with skin injuries, eating ''high risk'' dishes in the last 2 weeks and having ill pigs at home in the last 4 weeks were associated with S. suis meningitis, after adjustment for residency, age and sex (Table 5 ). S. suis infection was independently associated with occupations related to pigs, exposures to pigs or pork in the presence of skin injuries in the 2 weeks prior to infection, and eating ''high risk'' dishes in the 2 weeks prior to infection after multivariate analysis. These associations were found in comparisons of cases with the hospital control group as well as with the community control group. Breeding pigs at home, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism or exposure to pigs or pork without skin injuries were not associated with S. suis infection in multivariate analysis (Table 6 ). In a sensitivity analysis, which included only male cases and controls, exactly the same risk factors were significant with similar odds ratios as in the main analysis. Risk factors identified by multivariate analysis of male cases and controls from either control group included eating ''high risk'' dishes (OR 1 ''High risk'' dishes predominantly consisted of undercooked food (Table 3 ). Exposure to pigs or pork in the presence of skin injuries, eating ''high risk'' dishes, or both, were reported in 72/ 101 S. suis cases (71.3%), 91/303 hospital controls (30%) and 84/ 300 community controls (28%). For 26 S. suis cases (25.7%), compared to 52 hospital controls (17.2%) and 29 community controls (9.7%), eating these ''high risk'' dishes was the only risk factor reported.",
