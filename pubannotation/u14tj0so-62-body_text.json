    "text": "For pseudoknotted structures, using HotKnots hotspots as input is far superior to using SimFold as input, for both HFold and Iterative HFold. This appears to be because MFE structures predicted by SimFold tend to have more base pairs than the true pseudoknot free structure, G big , so that HFold and Iterative HFold are unlikely to add pseudoknotted base pairs to the input structure. For pseudoknotfree structures, using SimFold as input is somewhat better than using HotKnots hotspots, but the permutation test indicates that the difference is not significant.",
