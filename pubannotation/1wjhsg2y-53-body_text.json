    "text": "In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of bats as reservoirs for zoonotic viruses that jeopardize public health and food security, yet are threatened by a multitude of human activities that alter host-virus dynamics. We highlight that Western Asia is a region with a diverse bat fauna comprising 96 species that overlap at the biogeographic crossroads of Asia, Oceania, Africa, and Europe. Through literature searches based on key terms in PubMed, we demonstrate that research on bats and bat-associated viruses is highly fragmented across the region, and severely limited in most countries. Challenges due to political instability and resource availability in some Western Asian countries has likely contributed to this limited research effort on bats and their viruses. We propose that collaborative scientific research-notably a regional bat research network, the Western Asia Bat Research Network (WAB-Net)-could have the ability to rise above such challenges when faced with a common goal and driven by strong network engagement with a mission toward sustainability. The WAB-Net will facilitate cross-border research cooperation to guard against threats posed by humans that jeopardize bat populations and promote zoonotic disease outbreaks, and will serve as a model for the development of additional research networks to study host-virus dynamics in other taxa native to Western Asia, in particular known reservoirs of zoonotic diseases (e.g., rodents in Iran [155] ). We strongly advocate a \"bats for peace\" mission for WAB-Net by promoting data sharing and a culture of meaningful transboundary scientific collaboration to develop a sustainable bat research network and serve as an instrument for the early detection of zoonotic disease threats in this politically volatile region.",
