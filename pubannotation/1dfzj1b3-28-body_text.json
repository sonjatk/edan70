    "text": "The antioxidant activities of other oils isolated from diverse Iranian plants were also assayed [48, 49] . In both cases the activities were weak. The percentage inhibition of Salvia eremophila Boiss. oil was of about one third of that of BHT, in contrast to the methanolic extracts of the same plant, which presented activities comparable to that of BHT. The authors considered the absence of phenolic compounds in the oils responsible for such weak activity. α-Pinene, borneol, camphene and transcaryophyllene were the main components of the oil [48] . For the Psammogeton canescens (DC.) vatke oil the authors [49] also attributed the weak activity of the oils to the presence of β-bisabolene, apiole, α-pinene and dill apiole, all non-phenolic compounds.",
