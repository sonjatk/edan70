    "text": "Establishing a successful bat One Health research program in Western Asia will require hands-on, hypothesis-driven research projects that integrate applied bat ecology with disease surveillance. International collaborative research is most effective and relevant to policy makers when organized around specific hypotheses and validated with experimental data [146, 147] . Further, international research is most likely to be successful if the specific topics and hypotheses are identified by local (in-region) scientists and stakeholders. Toward this aim, WAB-Net is working with key personnel from throughout the region to develop a robust collaborative research program on bats and bat-associated CoVs. This multinational research program will use a combination of field, laboratory, and analytical methods to address outstanding questions surrounding drivers of host-virus dynamics.",
