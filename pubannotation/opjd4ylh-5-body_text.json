    "text": "In the Limpopo Province of South Africa, TB is ranked the fourth among the major causes of death [5] . In 2009, the Limpopo Provincial TB Annual Report [6] stated that the number of TB cases in Vhembe district was 2194. In 2012, Vhembe district had the highest number of TB patients in the Limpopo Province [7] . Tshitangano et al. [8] , further indicated that TB infection control plans were not available at hospitals in Vhembe district and this contributed to the high number of TB patients. Infection control requires both human and material resources for maintenance and support [8] . In line with this assertion, Gursimrat [9] argues that one of the major challenges to control TB infection includes poor primary healthcare infrastructure. In addition, shortage of space and beds in the wards hinder separation of Multi-Drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB) and TB patients in healthcare facilities and these increases risk of contracting infection in the wards [10] . Healthcare-associated TB has become a major occupational hazard for healthcare workers. It was therefore imperative to explore and describe the experiences of nurses caring for tuberculosis patients at a regional hospital in Vhembe district, Limpopo Province.",
