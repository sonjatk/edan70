    "text": "As a whole, our data imply that regulatory polymorphisms which alter expression levels of upstream regulators of this gene network (such as Nkx2-5, Mef2a, SRF, Nostrin, Znf451, and Ttn) might predispose to atrial fibrillation. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that expression of Ttn, one of our candidate upstream regulators, is increased in atrial fibrillation patients with persistent disease (Deshmukh et al. 2015 ) and a recent GWAS that has for the first time identified the TTN locus as a susceptibility locus for atrial fibrillation in humans (Christophersen et al. 2017) . Further, genes within our gene network that are regulated by the Chr2 eQTL containing Ttn are also dysregulated in atrial fibrillation (Rbm20, Atp2a2, Fndc5, and Mybphl) (Deshmukh et al. 2015) and dysregulation of transcription factors and ion/calcium handling genes could drive the switch from working myocardium to the pacemaker phenotype observed in the pulmonary myocardium in atrial fibrillation.",
