    "text": "A previous study showed that NS5A decreases the CSFV IRES-mediated translation in a dose-dependent manner [13] . To examine the effects of eEF1A on the NS5A-mediated inhibition of the CSFV IRES activity, the luciferase reporter assay was used in this study. The results showed that eEF1A ( Figure 5A ), as well as NS5A ( Figure 5B ), inhibited the CSFV IRES activity in a dose-dependent manner. To further investigate the inhibitory effects of eEF1A and NS5A coexpression, eEF1A-and NS5A-expressing plasmids were cotransfected with the luciferase reporter plasmids into HEK293T cells. The results indicated that the eEF1A did not antagonize the inhibition of the IRES activity by NS5A when NS5A and eEF1A were coexpressed ( Figure 5C ). ",
