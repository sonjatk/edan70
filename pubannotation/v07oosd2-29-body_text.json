    "text": "In the literature, many alternatives to antimicrobial usage in food-producing animals have been reported and discussed [87] [88] [89] [90] . The most promising way to mitigate the development of colistin resistance is to reduce the use of antimicrobials at the farm level (Table 2 ). There are documented relationships between housing conditions and incidence of PWD in pig herds; Madec et al. [30] claimed that prevention of PWD disorders could be based solely on the control of zootechnical conditions. Moreover, stocking density reduction could be considered as a paramount strategy to decrease occurrence of PWD as well as other diseases in pigs [91] . Thus, improvement of breeding conditions in pig farms is a crucial measure to reduce the susceptibility of animals to microbial infections and consequently to reduce the use of antimicrobials in pig production [28] . The management strategies around weaning should focus on measures that avoid any kind of stress for pigs. These measures include preventing the spread of infection, providing the pigs with good thermal comfort, giving them adapted feed and allowing access to this feed for all pigs. Considerable research has been performed into developing diets for weaners and there is now a range of high quality diets that are readily digested by the early-weaned pig [31] . The main purposes of these diets are to achieve A powerful oral immunogen The proposed immunization procedure required large quantities of F4 [8] Leads to a specific mucosal immune response Antigen degraded by the pH of the stomach and by digestive enzymes",
