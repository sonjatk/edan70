    "text": "We retrospectively revised all the files of children aged 0-14 years who were visited for acute asthma from 1 January to 31 December 2016 in the Pediatric ED of S. Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital of Bologna, Italy. All the patients with a diagnosis of \"acute asthma,\" \"wheezing bronchitis,\" and \"bronchospasm\" were included. Our center is an urban, academic, tertiary care Pediatric Emergency Unit, consisting of a Pediatric ED with approximately 23000 visits per year of children aged 0-14, a shortstay observation with 6 beds, and a ward with 28 beds. Patients arriving at the ED are registered by a triage-qualified nurse and seen first by pediatric residents and the attending physician. Two more nurses are available for the ED patients and 1 for the short-stay observation.",
