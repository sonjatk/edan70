    "text": "Based on the simulation results, the number of expiratory droplets in the breathing zone of each passenger can be obtained according to the locations of the suspended aerosols and the breathing zone. Then the volume density of expiratory droplets v(x,t) can be calculated and the intake fraction can also be obtained by using Eq. (1). Figure 5 shows the exposure levels of eighteen selected passengers from line 1~12 and seat A~F for case 1~3, including seven passengers infected with SARS after the flight (passenger 2C, 5E, 7D, 8E, 9B, 11B and 12B) and eleven healthy passengers (passenger 1D, 3E, 4C, 6D, 7 F, 8A, 9A, 10B, 10D, 11 F and 12C). The exposure level is demonstrated by the relative intake dose, which is the intake fraction of the passenger in each time step. The seating plan of the passengers can be found in Figure 1 . Figure 5 shows that the relative intake dose of each passenger is significantly different for different moving speeds. Even the passengers seated 8 rows ahead or 3 rows behind the index patient are affected by the movement. Hence the volume density distribution of expiratory droplets in the airplane cabin and the relative intake dose of each passenger can be significantly influenced by human movement. Figure 6 demonstrates the intake fraction distribution induced by one cough in the airplane cabin for case 13 , respectively. Passengers who are seated close to the index patient (especially for row 7-10, seat D-F) have much higher intake fractions than other passengers. The intake fractions of the passengers seated on the right side of the moving person (seat D-F) are slightly higher than that on the left side (seat A-C). Lower intake fractions can be found from the passengers seated far away from the index patient (row 1-4). Comparing Figure 6 (a)~(c), differences can be found in the intake fraction of every passenger. After human movement, more than half of the passengers will have higher intake fractions (41 passengers for case 2 and 38 for case 3). Compared with case 1, the variation range of the intake fractions is −91%~+472% for case 2 and −99%~+255% for case 3. The average intake fraction of all the 71 seated passenger (with the index patient and the moving person excluded) is 1.69 × 10 −6 , 1.75 × 10 −6 and 1.91 × 10 −6 for case 1~3. That means the movement of the standing person may lead to a 3.3%9",
