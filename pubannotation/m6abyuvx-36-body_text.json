    "text": "The pBR322-based plasmid vector pBMSF7C contained the ATI/p7.5 hybrid promoter within the hemagglutinin gene region of the vaccinia virus, which was reconstructed from the pSFJ1-10 plasmid and pBM vector [41, 42] . Separate full-length cDNAs encoding either the HCV structural protein, nonstructural protein, or all HCV proteins were cloned from HCV R6 strain (genotype 1b) RNA by RT-PCR. Each cDNA was inserted into a separate pBMSF7C vector downstream of the pBMSF7C ATI/p7.5 hybrid promoter; the final designation of each recombinant plasmid was pBMSF7C-CN2, pBMSF7C-N25, or pBMSF-CN5 (Figure 2 ). They were then transfected into primary rabbit kidney cells infected with LC16m8 (multiplicity of infection = 10). The viruscell mixture was harvested 24 h after the initial transfection by scrapping; the mixture was then frozen at 280uC until use. The hemagglutinin-negative recombinant viruses were cloned as previously described [42] and named rVV-CN2, rVV-N25, or rVV-CN5. Insertion of the HCV protein genes into the LC16m8 genome was confirmed by direct PCR, and expression of each protein from the recombinant viruses was confirmed by western blot analysis. The titers of rVV-CN2, rVV-N25, and rVV-CN5 were determined using a standard plaque assay and RK13 cells.",
