    "text": "Half-area 96-well plates (Corning) were coated with 5 mg/ml (250 ng/well) of goat anti-human Fc antibody and incubated over night at 4uC. Plates were then washed with PBS and blocked with 4% non-fat dry milk for 1 hour at room temperature (RT). After washing, capture antibodies were added at 5 mg/ml (250 ng/well), and plates were incubated an additional hour at RT. Next, virus was added to washed plates (20 ng p24/well) and incubated for 3 hours at 37uC. Unbound virus was removed by washing with PBS. Subsequently, 1610 4 TZM-bl cells/well were added in the presence of 10 mg/ml DEAE dextran and incubated for 48 hours at 37uC. Cells were then washed, lysed, and developed with luciferase assay reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Luminescence (relative light units) was measured using a Synergy 2 microplate luminometer (BioTek).",
