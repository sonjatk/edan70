    "text": "In addition to cell surface expressed host factors, HCV internalization and fusion are complex processes that also offer several targets for antivirals. A recent study demonstrated that long phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (PS-ON) inhibited HCV internalization without affecting viral binding and replication [117] . The human liver-chimeric Alb-uPA/SCID mouse model also showed that PS-ON block de novo HCV infection. These data shed light on the promise of PS-ON as future clinical solution.",
