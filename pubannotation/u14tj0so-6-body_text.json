    "text": "Many computational thermodynamics-based methods find the structures with the minimum free energy (MFE) from the set of all possible structures, when each structure feature is assigned a free energy value and the energy of a structure is calculated as the sum of the features' energies. There has been significant success in prediction of pseudoknot-free secondary structures (structures with no crossing base pairs) [23, 25, 26] . While many small RNA secondary structures are pseudoknot-free, many biologically important RNA molecules, both in the cell [27, 28] , and in viral RNA [29] are found to be pseudoknotted.",
