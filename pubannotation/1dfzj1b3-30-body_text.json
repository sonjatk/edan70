    "text": "This method measures the malondialdehyde (MDA) formed after lipid hydroperoxide decomposition (secondary products of oxidation), which forms a pink chromophore with thiobarbituric acid (TBA). This coloured complex, which absorbs at 532 nm, results in the condensation of TBA and malondialdehyde in an acidic environment. This method is not very specific, because 4-hydroxyalkenals, 2,4-alkadienals and 2-alkenals, protein and sugar degradation products, amino acids, nucleic acids and anthocyanins are also able to react with TBA, forming a chromophore [5] .",
