    "text": "Among our patients, almost one-third had a previous diagnosis of asthma or wheezing. Half of them were in the school age, meaning that they were the real asthmatics of the case series, according to what is previously described by Stein and Martinez [23] . For them, the chance of needing hospitalization was higher than their peers with no previous asthma diagnosis. Among this group of older children with known asthma, up to 2/3 were not using controller medications, either for no prescription or for low compliance, and, according to our results, were at higher risk of a moderatesevere exacerbation than those using it. Controller medications are indicated in children with persistent asthma, and their correct use has been shown to reduce exacerbations and thereby ED visits for asthma [21, 24] . Evaluating asthma severity was beyond the goals of our study; thereby we cannot say how many of the 63 asthmatic children aged over 5 years and not using long-term controller therapy would have had a real need of such a prescription. However, the fact that so many asthmatic children were not using controller therapy, although our National Health System provides a pediatricsspecialized general practitioner for all children until the age of 14, seems to point out the need for an improvement in the territorial network of asthma management.",
