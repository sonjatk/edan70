    "text": "Highly localized signature of positive selection in PARP4 PARP4, also known as vPARP (vault PARP) is a catalytically active poly-ADP-ribosyltransferase that is a component of widely conserved, large cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein structures known as ''vaults''. Vaults are barrel-shaped particles composed of three proteins, MVP (major vault protein), PARP4, and TEP1 (telomerase associated protein), as well as vRNA (vault RNA) [44] . The function of vaults is unknown, but they have been implicated in drug resistance, cancer and immunity. In support of a role in immunity, MVP, the core structural component of the . 10 mDa mass of vaults, is upregulated by IFN, and vaults are most highly expressed in immune cell types such as dendritic cells and macrophages [45] .",
