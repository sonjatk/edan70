    "text": "We analyzed samples that were previously screened for the presence of Bartonella by Becker et al. [49] using nested PCR to amplify a region of the citrate synthase gene (gltA) [51] . Among the Bartonella-positive samples, we randomly selected 5-10 positive samples per site for Sanger sequencing (n = 51). PCR products were purified with DNA Clean & Concentrator Kits (Zymo Research) and sequenced in both directions at the Georgia Genomics Facility. Resulting chromatograms were checked for quality and trimmed using Geneious (Biomatters) [52] . Post-trimmed forward and reverse sequences were assembled to create 348 base pair (bp) consensus sequences for each sample (n = 35; the quality of 16 chromatograms was too low).",
