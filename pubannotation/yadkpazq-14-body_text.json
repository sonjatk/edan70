At the time points indicated, cells were harvested and counted. 10 6 cells of either cell line were resuspended in 30 μL sample buffer (0.5 M Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 5% SDS, 10% βmercaptoethanol, 40% glycerol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue) and boiled at 95°C for 5 min. SDS-PAGE separation and submersed immunoblotting procedures were carried out as previously described [61] . The Spectra Multicolor Broad Range Protein Ladder (Fermentas GmbH, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) served as molecular weight standard marker for each blot. For protein visualization, membranes were first cut immediately below the 80kB marker band. The top and bottom membrane fractions were incubated with murine anti-human Mx MAb M143 (generously provided by Dr J. Pavlovic, Institute for Virology, University of Zürich, Switzerland) and murine anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody as a loading control (Sigma Aldrich GMbH, Buchs, Switzerland) respectively. Both fractions were subsequently incubated with a peroxidase-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch, Newmarket, Suffolk, UK). Bands were digitalized using the Chemigenius 2 BioImaging System (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). With the exception of assays carried out with FPV, viral inhibition experiments were conducted simultaneously and with supernatants thawed an equal number of times. The treated cells were then inoculated with virus (VSV, FCV, FHV, FCoV) or trypsinized with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco ® , Invitrogen) and allowed to settle in viral suspension (FPV), and inhibition assays were carried out after 24 h (72 h for FCoV and FPV) according to the procedure described previously [62] . Briefly, supernatants were discarded and cell debris was removed from the wells by 3 cycles of washing with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) (Gibco, Invitrogen) and shaking on an orbital shaker for 15 s. Remaining cells were fixed with 5% formalin and stained with a crystal violet solution. For spectrophotometric measurements, 100% methanol was added to the dried out wells and absorbance was read at 595 nm on a SpectraMax Plus 384 microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Bucher Biotec AG, Basel, Switzerland). Viral inhibition rates were calculated with the following formula:",
