    "text": "Initial studies suggested that MERS-CoV RBD domain in S1 glycoprotein represents a suitable target for the development of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies [62, [74] [75] [76] . Hence, the idea to develop neutralizing mouse mAbs as a strategy to prevent the entry of MERS-CoV into host cells was led by Du et al. [75] . mAbs were made by vaccinating mice with IgG1 Fc to which recombinant MERS-CoV S1 was fused [75] . Consequently, Mersmab1, the most effective murine mAb was developed that targeted MERS-CoV RBD, and successfully neutralized MERS-CoV infection in Vero E6, Huh-7 and Calu-3 cells [76] . These studies indicated the potential of humanized mAbs as efficient curative agents against infection caused by MERS-CoV. Around April 2014, three independent studies first reported to have developed complete humanized MERS-CoV neutralizing mAbs [77, 78] . All these humanized mAbs specifically targeted the MERS-CoV RBD glycoprotein. The efficacy of human mAbs against MERS-CoV infection was first exhibited by Qiu et al. [79] . They were able to completely treat MERS-CoV infection of lethal nature with a single dose of humanized mAbs in the hDPP4 transgenic mouse [79] .",
