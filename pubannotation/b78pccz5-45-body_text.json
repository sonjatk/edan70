    "text": "Similar results were obtained in the review by Sepp√§nen et al. (2004) [7] . They None of the studies included in the reviews specifically addressed the role of outdoor air quality on indoor exposures, even though 90% of EU citizens live in areas where the WHO guidelines for air quality for PM 2.5 is not met [10] . Neither was the existence of indoor air sources systematically analysed nor exposure levels quantified or considered when associating ventilation and health. Therefore the support from these previous studies on determining the best combination of source control and ventilation levels is limited. This work aims to summarize the current understanding of the sources of health risks in indoor environments and their relationship to ventilation requirements. The methods presented here allow for informed health-based optimization of efforts aimed at reducing harmful exposures and improving health of the occupants. The results are intended for development of national and international guidelines and standards, and can also be used as background information when",
