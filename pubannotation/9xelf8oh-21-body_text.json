    "text": "Non-specific binding was not evident (using agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products) in samples assayed in uniplex, duplex or triplex analyses. That all assays amplified the correct target region was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Online Resource S7, Fig. S7 .2-S7.7). The assays appear specific to the intended squirrel pathogens, as neither SQPV nor SADV qPCR assays amplified (0/6 reactions) a product in qPCRs seeded with either cowpox, monkeypox or canine adenovirus 1 or 2 DNA.",
