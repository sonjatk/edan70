    "text": "It has generally been assumed that any non-neutral mutations within the influenza genome have arisen as selective adaptations and generally help drive influenza toward a stronger and more dangerous pathogen (in terms of either pathenogenicity or transmissibility) [41] . This was probably the basis for the extreme caution exhibited during the 2009-2010 H1N1 outbreak. There is a general perception that, given enough time, Figure 7 Relative synonymous codon usage in the direct 1918 human H1N1 lineage for the four alanine codons, after adjusting the \"frozen\" portion of the lineage (1976-2009) by 21 years. Note that the two decreasing in frequency over time are exactly matched by the two increasing over time (i.e., non-synonymous changes are having a negligible effect). Also, three of these lines (GCA, GCC, and GCG) indicate these codons are drifting even farther away from the human average. H1N1 might mutate into a stronger pathogen, and hence might create another catastrophic pandemic, as it did in 1918.",
