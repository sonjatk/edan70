    "text": "We compared the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of Thai CaKoVs against those of reference viruses from the US, UK, Italy, China, and Korea (Tables 2 and 3 most variable region of VP1 is position 201-243, especially proline rich region. Putative proline rich region at VP1-228-240 (P 228 XPPPPXPPXPXP 240 ) was also observed in Thai CaKoVs as well as reference viruses (Table 4 ). In this study, unique amino acids were found in Thai and Chinese CaKoVs at the position, 65 V, 67D, 119L, 138T, 150P, 151M, 153D, 201S, 204Q, 205Q, 201Q, 213T and 241E ( Table 4 ). Analysis of predicted amino acid cleavage sits of whole genome were conserved among Thai CaKoVs (Table 5 ).",
