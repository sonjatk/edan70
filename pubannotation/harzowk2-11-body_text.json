    "text": "In-house real-time RT-PCRs were performed according to hospital laboratory standard operating procedures for the qualitative detection of human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) RNA and of Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP). The target of amplification for hMPV was the nucleoprotein gene (N gene) with primer sequences and method as described by Hopkins et al. and 45 cycles were run on real-time PCR (ABI prism 7900 HT FAST) [17] . Positive and negative controls were included, and a Ct value of ≤37 was considered positive. The target of amplification for MP was the ADPribosylating toxin gene encoding the CARDS (communityacquired respiratory distress syndrome) toxin using primer pairs and method as described by Winchell et al. [18] . Both internal DNA control and a positive and negative control were included in the reaction run. A Ct value ≤34 was considered positive.",
