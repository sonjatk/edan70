    "text": "The innate immune response provides the first line of defense against viral infections. This defense includes physical and chemical barriers such as the skin and mucous membranes and the acidity of the stomach. They serve as an initial barrier that protects the host from infection. Once these barriers have been breached, the innate immune response relies on a set of germline-encoded receptors, known as pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize pathogen specific molecular patterns that are sensed as a danger signal by the host cell [95, 96] . Engagement of PRRs results in the activation of several defense mechanisms including, production of interferon (IFN), induction of phagocytosis, cytokines, chemokines, antimicrobial peptides, antiviral proteins, as well as activation of leukocytes and T-cells. Furthermore, the innate immune response harbors cellular components, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells [97] .",
