    "text": "While several ubiquitin ligases have been shown to regulate AMPARs (reviewed in Goo et al., 2015) , much less is known about the relevant DUBs. USP-46 was identified in a focused RNAi screen in C. elegans as the first DUB to regulate GluRs. Usp-46 loss-of-function mutants exhibit increased levels of ubiquitinated GLR-1 and decreased levels of GLR-1 at synapses (Kowalski et al., 2011) . The abundance of GLR-1(4KR), a mutant receptor which cannot be ubiquitinated, is unaffected in usp-46 loss-of-function mutants leading to a model where USP-46 deubiquitinates GLR-1 to regulate its abundance. USP-46 regulation of GLR-1 is physiologically relevant because usp-46 loss-of-function mutants have reduced cell surface levels of GLR-1 and corresponding defects in GLR-1dependent behaviors. Together with data showing that USP-46 partially colocalizes with endosomes, Kowalski et al. (2011) proposed a model where USP-46 acts at endosomes to promote GLR-1 stability and recycling to the cell surface. Consistent with this model, a recent study showed that mammalian GluA1(KR), which cannot be ubiquitinated, escapes lysosomal degradation and recycles back to the cell surface (Widagdo et al., 2015) .",
