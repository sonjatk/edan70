    "text": "Sequence IDs are used for tagging sequences also in multiple sequence alignments and sequence-based phylogenetic trees in various presentations including publications [9] [10] [11] [12] ). Notwithstanding UniProt/SwissProt [2] entry names (Table 1) , these machine-readable IDs are not very informative in human communications. Consequently, sequence IDs are commonly replaced by biologically meaningful names and acronyms, e.g. species names in trees and gene/protein names in alignments. When a large-scale dataset is to be processed, manual replacement of IDs with names could be a tedious task prone to mistakes and omissions.",
