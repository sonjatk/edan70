    "text": "We hence hypothesize that the virus might have spread to the oviduct either systemically or via alternative routes, either by ascending the cloaca, or by contact with the infected abdominal air sacs and ovary. The latter case would be in keeping with the replication of the virus in the mesothelial cells of the oviduct serosa and the strong binding of the labelled virus to these cells. Unfortunately, Figure 6 Virus-histochemistry of the oviduct. Red staining indicates the binding of the FITC-labelled virus to the tissues. Sections are counterstained with hematoxylin. A The infundibulum showed a highly specific and uniform positivity of the cilia at the level of the epithelium lining the fimbriae. B In the magnum, we observed a specific staining of the ciliated epithelium but intensity was lower compared with the infundibulum. C No attachment of the virus was observed at the level of the isthmus epithelium. D The uterus showed a scattered but specific attachment of the virus to the cytoplasm of epithelial goblet cells.",
