    "text": "where b is the infection transmission rate and N is the total population size. The probability of remaining infectious through time is governed by the survivorship function, P(t), and as such the average infectious period, denoted by 1/c, is given by R ' 0 PðtÞdt [21] . The probability density function of the infectious period, p(t), is just the negative derivative of the survivorship function, ÀdP(t)/dt. Different functional forms for p(t) give rise to alternative assumptions concerning the distribution of the infectious period in the model. For example, setting p(t) equal to e Àct /c recovers the classical exponentially distributed SIR model. More realistic distributions can be obtained by choosing p(t) to be a gamma probability density function [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , with parameters c and n (see Protocol S1). An alternative (and computationally efficient) means of modeling infections with gamma distributions is to divide the infectious class into n subclasses with nc being the rate of sequential progression through the subclasses. The advantage of this formalism is that when n ¼ 1 we recover the exponentially distributed model, which has a large variance, while as n!' we obtain a fixed infectious period. The effects of n on the distribution of the infectious period are demonstrated in Figure 1A ; in Table 1 we present some examples of latent and infectious period distributions estimated from data.",
