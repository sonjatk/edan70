    "text": "Hantaviruses (family Bunyaviridae, genus Hantavirus) are negative-stranded, trisegmented viruses that cause about 200,000 disease cases annually, with case fatality rates of 0.5%-40%, depending on the virus [1] . The viral gene segments encode four or five polypeptides. The large (L) segment encodes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the medium (M) segment encodes a precursor that is posttranslationally cleaved into Gn and Gc glycoproteins, and the small (S) segment encodes the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Some hantaviruses encode a second nonstructural polypeptide (NSs) downstream from the N start site in frame 2 [2, 3] . Little is known about the immunomodulatory abilities of these proteins; however, there is evidence the N, Gn and NSs may alter host cellular responses during infection.",
