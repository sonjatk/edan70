    "text": "Î±-Humulene and trans-caryophyllene, the main constituents of Cordia verbenacea inhibited the LPS-induced NF-kB activation and neutrophil migration in the rat paw, however unable to inhibit LPS-induced MAP kinase activation [113] . The essential oils of diverse Pimpinella species and their isolates were able to inhibit NF-kB transcription induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) in SW1353 cells. However, they did not present similar activities. The most remarkable activity was reported for three Pimpinella species and five pure compounds: Pimpinella corymbosa Boiss., Pimpinella tragium Vill. ssp. polyclada (Boiss. et Heldr. Tutin), Pimpinella rhodanta Boiss. oils and 4-(2-propenyl)phenylangelate, 4-(3-methyloxiranyl)phenyltiglate, 4-methoxy-2-(3-methyloxiranyl)phenyl isobutyrate, 4-methoxy-2-(3-methyloxiranyl)phenylangelate and epoxypseudoisoeugenol-2-methylbutyrate [146] . These results also indicated the importance of a common structure (epoxyphenylpropanoid moiety) present in some of these pure compounds for the best anti-inflammatory activity.",
