    "text": "To assess how Foxp3 + Treg depletion affects endogenous SR T cells during JHMV persistence, we chose DEREG mice, which express the human diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor under the control of the Foxp3 promoter (22) . Incomplete DT-mediated Foxp3 + Treg depletion in naive adult DEREG mice is advantageous to our studies as it enables a window to study effects of Foxp3 + Treg ablation on myelin reactive CD4 + T cells without confounding complications of lymphoproliferative disease and systemic lethal autoimmunity (23, 24) . DT treatment of JHMV-infected DEREG mice at the peak of SR T cell CNS infiltration (between days 21 and 28 post infection), resulted in increased lymphocyte expansion and T cell activation in CLN, coincident with elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression compared to DT-treated controls. More importantly, Foxp3 + Treg ablation specifically increased frequencies of myelin-specific but not virus-specific CD4 + T cells, indicating preferential regulation of peripheral SR T cells by Foxp3 + Tregs. Surprisingly however, CNS inflammation, viral persistence, and demyelination remained similar consistent with no changes in virus and myelin-specific CD4 + T cells within the CNS. The apparent redundant role of Foxp3 + Tregs in regulating CNS inflammation implied a potential protective function of Tr1 cells. Analysis of SR T cells during chronic JHMV infection of IL-27R −/− mice, which lack Tr1 cells, revealed no effects within the CLN. By contrast, both virus-specific and SR CD4 + T cells were increased within the CNS of IL-27R −/− relative to wild-type (WT) mice. Altogether, these data indicate differential regulation of SR CD4 + T cells within the CLN versus CNS during chronic JHMV infection. While Foxp3 + Tregs specifically control myelinspecific CD4 + T cells within CLN, Tr1 cells limit SR T cells within the CNS.",
