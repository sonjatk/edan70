    "text": "Confluent cell monolayers of CEF or HaCat cells were infected at a MOI of 5 with recombinant MVA expressing the MERS-CoV N or S protein [23] . Non-infected (mock) or wild-type MVA-infected cells served as controls. Cell lysates were prepared at different time points after infection and stored at −80 • C. Total cell proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-10% polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) and subsequently transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane via electroblotting. After 1 h blocking in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) buffer containing 1% (w/v) non-fat dried milk and 0.1% (v/v) NP-40 detergent, the blots were incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-MERS-CoV Nucleocapsid antibody (Sino Biological, Beijing, China, 1:1000), monoclonal rabbit anti-MERS-CoV Spike Protein S1 Antibody (Sino Biological, 1:500), or polyclonal sera from MERS-CoV infected rabbits or cynomolgus macaques (kindly provided by Dr. Bart Haagmans, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, 1:1000) [23] as primary antibodies. After washing with 0.1% NP-40 in PBS, the blots were incubated with anti-mouse IgG (1:5000), or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:5000), or protein A (1:1000) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling Technology, Frankfurt am Main, Germany). After further washing, blots were developed using SuperSignal®West Dura Extended Duration substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Planegg, Gemany).",
