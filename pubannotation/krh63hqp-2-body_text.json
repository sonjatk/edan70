    "text": "At the close of World War I, the H1N1 influenza A virus swept the world [1] . During the 1917-1918 pandemic, approximately 40% of the human population was infected, with a death rate above 2%. It is estimated that this virus killed more people than died in the world war that was just then ending. Mortality rates have dramatically declined since then [2] , but the H1N1 flu has persisted. As a zoonotic pathogen, the influenza virus is able to infect multiple species. It is generally thought that aquatic waterfowl are a primary natural influenza reservoir [3] , where there are usually no clinical symptoms [4] , and where low level transmission probably perpetuates the viral pool [5] . All 14 influenza subtypes are maintained in waterfowl [5] .",
