    "text": "There appears to be a genetic influence in exhibiting KD. Incidence is higher in some genetic backgrounds and consistently appears in males greater than females within those backgrounds [16] . By age five in the United States, 1 in 1000 African-American children and 1 in 2000 Caucasian children will have been affected [17] [18] [19] . In general, Asians have a much higher rate of KD, this is especially evident in Japanese children, whose lifetime incidence rate is near 1% [20] . This predisposition holds even for those persons of Japanese heritage raised in foreign lands, such as the United States [16] .",
