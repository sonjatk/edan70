    "text": "The dynamical consequences of these differences in the distribution of infectious and latent periods have received some attention over the past two decades. It has been shown, for example, that the precise distribution of the infectious period has no qualitative effects on the asymptotic values or properties of the system [21, 24] , though perturbations to the endemic equilibrium take longer to die out as n increases [22, 26] . When contact rates vary seasonally, for example, to mimic the aggregation of children in schools [28, 29] , changes in p(t) are known to have important consequences for the persistence likelihood of infections [25, 26, 30 ]. An issue that has received surprisingly little attention, despite its obvious applicability to emerging infections and possible ''deliberate exposure,'' is the influence of latent and infectious period distributions on the invasion dynamics of an infection into a largely susceptible population. This is in contrast to the conceptually similar situation of within-host dynamics of viral disease, such as HIV, for which some models already adopt realistic distributions to describe stages in the cell life cycle [31, 32] . In particular, Lloyd [33] has shown how parameter estimates made from viral load data are affected by different assumptions about these distributions. Here we are interested in the application of this work to between-host transmission dynamics. As can be seen in Figure 1B , changes in the gamma distribution parameter n have substantial quantitative consequences for the epidemic curve: in comparison to a gamma-distributed model, the epidemic given by the exponentially distributed model (i) takes off at a dramatically slower rate, (ii) predicts a significantly smaller (approximately 56%) peak number of cases, and (iii) lasts much longer (almost twice as long).",
