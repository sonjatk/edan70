    "text": "It often has a diffuse pattern and the epidermis may present hyperkeratosis, acanthosis and ulceration [56, 68] . A nodular to diffuse arrangement of the granulomatous dermatitis is also reported [26, 60] . However, in a retrospective case series from Spain, two cats presented different histological findings [68] . The first one had granulomatous perifolliculitis with a high number of lymphocytes and plasma cells surrounding the cutaneous adnexa. It was associated with a marked hyperplasia of epidermis and sebaceous glands. The other cat was diagnosed with a lichenoid interface dermatitis typically represented by infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells and a few neutrophils and macrophages at the dermoepidermal junction. In this case, epidermal necrosis and epidermal microabscesses were also observed. A perivascular infiltration of superficial skin layers by macrophages, mast cells, neutrophils and eosinophils was also observed in another case [12] .",
