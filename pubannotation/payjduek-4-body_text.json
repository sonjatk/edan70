    "text": "Although not included in the diagnostic criteria of the disease, this clinical manifestation is reported in up to 50% of children with KD [7] . In addition, the clinical finding of BCG reactivation is regarded to be highly specific for KD, as it is very rarely described in other febrile illnesses or infections. For example, in a study of febrile Japanese children aged < 2 years admitted over an 8month period with diagnoses other than KD, no BCG reactivations were observed [8] . In contrast, data from a Japanese nationwide epidemiologic survey showed that > 70% of children in this age group who were diagnosed with KD developed BCG reactivation [8] . Measles infection has not been reported to cause BCG reactivation.",
