    "text": "Assessment of in vitro frameshift efficiencies employed pDluc/PRRSV wt and mutant derivatives. This vector contains the GG GUU UUU shift site, 5 upstream nucleotides (nt) and 66 downstream nt (79 nt in total) inserted between Renilla and firefly luciferase reporter genes of plasmid pDluc (27) such that −2 PRF is required for firefly luciferase expression. Protein expression vectors were as follows. PCBPs were cloned into pQE30 (Qiagen) at the BamH1/HindIII (PCBP1, 2, 3) or Sph1/HindIII (PCBP4) sites. Human PCBP1 (NM 006196.3) and PCBP2 (NM 005016.5) in pQE30 were kindly provided by Professor B. Semler, University of California, Irvine. PCBP3 (NM 021568.2 and XM 006513919.2) and PCPB4 (NM 033008.2 or XM 006713271.1) were obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using purified mRNA from mouse BV2 and human HeLa cells, repectively. Human hnRNP K/J (NM 002140.3; derived from HeLa cell mRNA by RT-PCR) was cloned into BamH1/XhoI-cut pET21a (Novagen). Nsp1␤ was cloned into BamH1/HindIII-cut pQE30 and BamH1/XhoI-cut pGEX6P2 (GE Healthcare). For analysis of ribosomal pausing, a 39-bp region of the PRRSV PRF region (with defective slippery sequence GGUAUUC, flanked by wildtype (WT) sequences comprising 5 nt upstream and 27 nt downstream) was cloned into the XhoI/PvuII sites of pPS0 (28) . Assessment of PRF efficiencies in cultured cells employed pL-nsp1␤-2, which encodes a self-cleaving nsp1␤-nsp2 polyprotein under the control of a T7 promoter (19) . Poliovirus P3/Leon/37 (accession number K01392.1) IRES SLIV was prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from plasmid pGemCat/PVIRES/Luc (kind gift of Dr Graham Belsham) and cloned into BamH1/EcoR1-cut pcDNA3.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).",
