    "text": "Flavivirus infection of porcine NEC. NEC were apically challenged with an MOI of 0.1 TCID 50 /cell for 1.5 h at 37°C. Then the virus inoculum was discarded, the NEC apical surface washed three times with prewarmed PBS Ϫ/Ϫ , and the inserts were transferred into new plates with fresh ALI medium in the basolateral chamber for culture at 37°C and 5% CO 2. Mock infection controls were included. After 24, 48, and 72 hpi, apical washes and basolateral medium were collected and stored at Ϫ70°C for later titrations. RNA was extracted from NEC at each indicated time postinfection. An extra insert was kept for 72 hpi to fix in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for immunolabeling.",
