    "text": "STAT activation experiments were performed as previously described [59] . The STAT reporter plasmids were kindly provided by Prof. Martin Zeidler (University of Sheffield) [60] . In brief, Hsu cells were transfected with STAT reporter plasmid p6x2DRAF-Luc (multimerised Drosophila STAT-responsive element with a Firefly luciferase reporter) and a control plasmid, pAct-Renilla (Renilla luciferase gene under control of the Drosophila actin 5C promoter for constitutive expression). Cells were also transfected with dsRNA against Cul4 or GFP. Cells were stimulated with heat inactivated E. coli, WNV (MOI = 1) or PBS (Control) for 1h. Luciferase activity was measured at 16 h post-stimulation. Heat-inactivated bacteria were prepared by incubating 1μl of E. coli DH5α in 5 ml LB medium at 37°C for 16 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS. Heat inactivation was achieved by incubating the cells for 10 min at 90°C. 1 μl of the suspension was used per well.",
