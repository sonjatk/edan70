This isolate exhibits several drug resistance mutations within the RT and the PR open reading frame, causing resistance to all nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and most PR inhibitors [63] (Figure 6E ). To analyze the influence of DIs on the replication capacity of HIV-1 4lig7 , HLAC were infected with HIV-1 4lig7 virus preparations standardized for p24, and structured or permanent treatment with indicated amounts of PR-619 and P22077 was applied ( Figure 6A-D) . Measuring the virus associated RT activity showed that both DIs induced the same dose-dependent reduction of replication capacity for the multidrug resistant HIV-1 field isolate, as it was observed for HIV-1 NL4-3 . Having demonstrated the anti-retroviral effect of the DIs PR-619 and P22077 for the T cell culture adapted molecular HIV-1 clone NL4-3, we examined whether those DIs also affect HIV-1 field isolates, like the multidrug resistant field isolate HIV-14lig7. This isolate exhibits several drug resistance mutations within the RT and the PR open reading frame, causing resistance to all nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and most PR inhibitors [63] (Figure 6E ). To analyze the influence of DIs on the replication capacity of HIV-14lig7, HLAC were infected with HIV-14lig7 virus preparations standardized for p24, and structured or permanent treatment with indicated amounts of PR-619 and P22077 was applied ( Figure 6A-D) . Measuring the virus associated RT activity showed that both DIs induced the same dose-dependent reduction of replication capacity for the multidrug resistant HIV-1 field isolate, as it was observed for HIV-1NL4-3. Previously, it was demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors interfere with HIV-1 Gag processing and virus infectivity [38] . Moreover, it has been shown that proteasome inhibitors block the replication capacity of HIV-1 in cell culture [64] . Both inhibitors, proteasome inhibitors and DIs, induce the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, albeit by different mode of action. Thus, it was intriguing to investigate whether proteasome inhibitors in combination with DIs would generate synergistic effects on HIV-1 replication capacity. Therefore, HLAC were infected with HIV-1NL4-3 and replication studies were performed as described above (see Figure 4 ). Following permanent treatment with increasing amounts of PR-619 or P22077 together with 0.6 nM of the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib, specific for the constitutive proteasome [65] , significant reduction in replication capacity was observed ( Figure 7A,C) . Similar results were obtained after permanent treatment with increasing amounts of PR-619 or P22077 and 10 nM PR-957, which is a specific inhibitor of the immunoproteasome [66] (Figure 7E,G) . In contrast, individual treatment with each DI or proteasome inhibitor alone had no influence on virus replication at this concentration range. Cell viability was assessed by WST-1 assay showing that all applied substances had no impact on cell viability in any individual or combinatory treatment scheme ( Figure 7B,D,F,H) . Together, these results reveal a synergistic antiretroviral activity of inhibitors that act on both components of the UPS, proteasomes and DUBs.
