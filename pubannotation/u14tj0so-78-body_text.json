    "text": "In this work, we compared two different ways to generate pseudoknot-free input structures for input to Iterative HFold, namely the first 50 suboptimal structures produced by SimFold, and HotKnots hotspots. On the HK-PK and HK-PK-free data sets, accuracy of Iterative HFold is not significantly different on each of these. An alternative approach that may be worth exploring in future work would be to use the most highly probable base pairs, as calculated using the partition function [43] . Even better may be to calculate base pair probabilities for base pairs of pseudoknotted RNA structures; however this requires (n 5 ) time. Since HFold finds minimum free energy structure in O(n 3 ) time, conditional on the given input structure, we are currently investigating ways to develop an O(n 3 )-time partition function version of HFold that can produce pseudoknotted base pair probabilities that are conditional on the given input structure.",
