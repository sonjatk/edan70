    "text": "Several isolated studies have been conducted since the H5N1 outbreak in late 2003 to monitor the molecular evolution at gene and genome level [8] , [9] . All these studies involve a phylogenetic analysis at one level or the other. However, no systematic efforts have been undertaken so far to evaluate the suitability of the used phylogenetic algorithms in yielding biologically meaningful results for the analysis of HA and NA gene products of H5N1 viruses in particular and influenza viruses in general.",
