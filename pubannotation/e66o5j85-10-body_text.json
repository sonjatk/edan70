    "text": "Samples were collected in the first 48 hours of patient hospitalization. Nasal swabs were taken from all pneumonia cases and controls. To document antibiotic usage history, urine was sampled from cases for broad spectrum antibiotic detection. Whole blood and pleural effusions (in applicable cases) were collected from cases only. Whole blood was distributed in Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) vials for preservation and in dry tubes for serum specimens. EDTA-whole blood samples allowed complete blood count, blood culture and real-time multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the identification of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b. C reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were measured quantitatively in serum.",
