    "text": "In this paper, epidemics refer to a spike, above normal, in the prevalence of a specific disease in a specific population (Centre for Disease Control and Prevention 2012). The literal definition of politics is the Bactivities that relate to influencing the actions and policies of a government or getting and keeping power in a government^ (Merriam-Webster 2016) . However, in the Bpolitics of epidemics^literature, politics often refers to the extensive and diverse influence of local, national, and international governments and organizations, on the health outcomes of communities during disease outbreaks. For the purposes of this paper, politics will also refer to how scholars talked about epidemics, and whose narratives are reported in the reviewed literature.",
