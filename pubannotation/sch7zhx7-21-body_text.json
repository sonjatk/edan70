    "text": "To quantify resistance, we measured viral titers of wildtype and protease-mutant virus in untreated and DFMO-treated Vero cells over a concentration range ( Figure 2B ). We infected these cells at MOI 0.1 and measured viral titers at 48 hpi. We again observed significant sensitivity by the wildtype virus with any concentration of DFMO; in contrast, both protease mutants exhibited significant resistance, again suggesting that these mutations confer resistance to polyamine depletion. We then measured percent replication by dividing the titer in DFMO treatment conditions (500 ÂµM) by the titer in untreated conditions from 48 hpi ( Figure 2C ). We observed that compared to wildtype virus, all mutants exhibited higher replication, and the protease mutations conferred similar levels of resistance. Combination of the mutations appeared to additively enhance replication; however, this difference was not statistically significant.",
