    "text": "In mammals, the pulmonary myocardium forms an atriovenous junction where the atrial myocardium extends into the vena cavae and pulmonary veins, forming a sleeve of myocardial tissue around the veins (Nathan and Eliakim 1966) . This myocardial sleeve is thought to maintain venous pressure and prevent blood reflux from the atrium during contraction (Nathan and Eliakim 1966) . Interestingly, autonomous electrical activity (Brunton and Fayrer 1876) and ectopic beats originating from the pulmonary myocardium (Chen et al. 1999 ) are implicated in atrial fibrillation. This is important because it has been estimated that atrial fibrillation affects .33 million people globally (Chugh et al. 2014) . Further, atrial fibrillation is associated with stroke, heart failure, significant morbidity, and increased mortality, leading to an estimated annual cost of $6.65 billion in the United States in 2005 (Reynolds and Essebag 2012). A number of studies have attempted to characterize and define the involvement of the pulmonary myocardium in atrial fibrillation (Chen et al.",
