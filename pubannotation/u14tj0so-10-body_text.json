    "text": "We previously presented HFold [48] , an approach for prediction of pseudoknotted structures, motivated by two goals, namely to avoid the high running time complexity of other methods for pseudoknotted secondary structure prediction and to leverage the hierarchical folding hypothesis. This hypothesis posits that an RNA molecule first folds into a pseudoknot-free structure; then additional base pairs are added that may form pseudoknots with the first structure so as to lower the structure's free energy [49] . Given a pseudoknot-free structure as input, HFold predicts a possibly pseudoknotted structure from a broad class that contains the given input structure and, relative to that constraint, has minimum free energy. HFold's running time is O(n 3 ), significantly faster than other methods for predicting pseudoknotted structures. Several experts have provided evidence for, and support, the hierarchical folding hypothesis [49] [50] [51] [52] . The class of structures that HFold can handle, density-2 structures, is quite general and includes many important pseudoknots including Htype pseudoknots, kissing hairpins and infinite chains of interleaved bands, with arbitrary nested (pseudoknotted) substructures. (Roughly, a structure is density-2 if no base is enclosed by more than two overlapping pseudoknotted stems.) Another advantage of HFold over heuristic methods such as HotKnots or ShapeKnots is that unlike these methods, HFold minimizes the free energy of the possibly pseudoknotted output structure relative to the given input structure. Therefore HFold's method of adding pseudoknotted stems is better motivated energetically than that of HotKnots or ShapeKnots.",
