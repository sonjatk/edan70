    "text": "Recurrent HCV infection after liver transplantation has increasingly become a major clinical issue that the hepatologist and transplant surgeons should face. During the past decade, numerous therapeutic approaches based on both basic research and clinical evidences have been reported, but the effective strategy still needs more efforts to be approved. Meanwhile, many critical questions remain in several aspects of HCV, including the viral infection cycle activities, the detailed structure, composition, and function of the HCV virion in host cells. In addition, current standard of therapeutic formula consisting of Pegylated IFN combined with ribavirin and an NS3/4A inhibitor is ineffective or only partially effective. In fact, as reviewed in this paper, many novel inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies targeting HCV proteins and host factors hold promise to effectively prevent or treat HCV. Hopefully, these future strategies will improve the overall outcome of HCV recipients after liver transplantation [101] .",
