    "text": "The poor response of symptoms to an in-vitro susceptibility guided, adequately dosed antibiotic treatment that we found, is similar to poor response findings in 2 other disease entities involving H. influenzae as a predominant pathogen in children; recurrent and unresponsive otitis media and protracted bacterial bronchitis [35] [36] [37] [38] . In the middle ear, biofilm formation has been demonstrated to be one of the major mechanisms for persistence and provides an explanation for unresponsiveness to antibiotic therapy [39, 40] . Moreover, biofilm formation and intracellular infection are well established mechanisms of NTHi for persistence in the lower airways [31] [32] [33] . Although our study does not provide evidence of biofilm formation in the lower airways of young unresponsive wheezers, our findings of poor response to and frequent relapse after a short course of antibiotic treatment are suggestive for involvement of biofilm. Biofilm formation should be addressed in future studies, because its presence may have consequences for treatment.",
