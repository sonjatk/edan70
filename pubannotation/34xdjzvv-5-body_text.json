    "text": "To assess the capabilities of cross-neutralization of N3 against genotype B4-and C2 strains of EV71, various concentrations of N3 (beginning with 50 mg) were incubated with either E59 (B4) or 5746 (C2) before infecting NIH3T3 cells constituting expressed human SCARB2 (3T3-SCARB2) [18] . The viral genomes in infected 3T3-SCARB2 cells were detected by RT-PCR reaction using primers specifically targeting to VP1 sequence of P1 transcripts of E59 or 5746 isolates. The results show that N3 inhibited the expression of P1 of E59 and 5746 in a concentrationdependent manner. The quantities of the expressed P1, compared to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were shown in a bar graph in Fig. 1 .",
