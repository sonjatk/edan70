    "text": "One of the possible mechanisms of the antioxidative action is the chelation of transition metals. Transition metal ions can stimulate lipid peroxidation by participating in the generation of initiating species and by accelerating peroxidation, decomposing lipid hydroperoxides into other components which are able to abstract hydrogen, perpetuating the chain of reaction of lipid peroxidation [52] .",
