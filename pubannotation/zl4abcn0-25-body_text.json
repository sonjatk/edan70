    "text": "Generally, lycorine was detected in the extracts of all different parts of H. littoralis. As shown in Table 2 , the highest content of lycorine was found in the bulb. This finding is in agreement with that of Abou-Donia et al. [13] that the bulbs of Narcissus cv. Breath of Spring plants possess higher amount of lycorine. Nevertheless, flower and anther extract also contained high amount of lycorine of 2.43 and 2.13 g per mg of extract, respectively. Stem and leaves extracts of H. littoralis had lesser lycorine content compared to previous plant parts, while the least amount of lycorine was found in the root extract.",
