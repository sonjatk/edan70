    "text": "The evaluation of the antioxidant activities of essential oils from Capparis spinosa L. and Crithmum maritimum L. from Dalmatia (Croatia) by different methods, showed that using TBARS method, the oils presented at 1 g/L (the highest concentration tested) lower ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation than BHA, but close to that of BHT. They also found that the activity was dosedependent. The differences of activity of both samples was not significant, although the differences in the chemical composition of the oils were. Capparis spinosa oil was predominantly constituted by methyl isothiocyanate, whereas sabinene and limonene were the main components of Crithmum maritimum oil [55] .",
