    "text": "H. influenzae was the predominant aerobic bacterial pathogen, isolated in 30.3 % of our patients. Although previously other authors have had similar results, isolated strains of H. influenzae were never further characterised [9, 10, 20, 23] . To our knowledge this is the first report that associates bronchial infection with nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHi) in young persistant wheezers. Identification of NTHi as the predominant pathogen further supports our hypothesis that persistent wheezers present an underlying inflammation induced by chronic bacterial infection. Chronic NTHI infection, resulting from the ability of NTHI to persist in the lower airways through several escape mechanisms from the host immune responses, has previously been reported by others [31] [32] [33] . Moreover, in the lower airways of patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, NTHI has been demonstrated to be a major inflammatory stimulus [31, 34] .",
