    "text": "Based on the observed cases, the minimum incidence for PCR-confirmed influenza-associated PICU admission per 100,000 children <17 years of age in Bavaria was calculated as 1.15/0.36/1.03 for seasons 1/2/3, respectively. Taking into account that the observed cases were based on data from 67 %/47 %/57 % of all eligible PICUs, the total number of influenza-associated PICU admissions in Bavaria was estimated and corrected incidences were calculated as 1.72/0.76/1.80 per 100,000 children <17 years. Subtype-specific corrected incidences were 1. 35 (Table 2) .",
