    "text": "In the direct competition methods, natural antioxidants compete for the peroxyl radical with a reference free radical scavenger. Examples of reference free radicals scavengers include the fluorescent natural protein R-phycoerithrin and the natural crocin, or fluorescein, which compete with the antioxidant sample for peroxyl radicals formed. These radicals may be produced through the addition of AAPH or AMVA. This is the principle of the so-called ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity) protocol. Another example is the bleaching of Î²-carotene during the autoxidation of linoleic acid or in a controlled chain reaction by using a free radical initiator: AAPH [29] .",
