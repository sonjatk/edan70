    "text": "For detection of H2-K b -bound SL-epitope, cells were stained with the allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated 25D1.16 mAb (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) diluted 1:100 in fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (5% (v/v) FCS, 0.02% (v/v) NaN 3 in PBS). For intracellular Gag staining, cells were permeabilized using Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA). Gag was detected by staining with a FITC-labeled anti-CA mAb (KC57; Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) diluted 1:100 in Perm/Wash buffer (BD Bioscience). For detection of total H2-K b molecules, cells were incubated with hybridoma cell culture supernatant containing the mAb B8-24-3 [57] , followed by staining with secondary Alexa 647-conjugated anti-mouse Ab (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur using CellQuest software (BD Bioscience). Data were analyzed by using the FACS Express V3 software (De Novo Software).",
