    "text": "Greenhouse gas (GHG) in our case study is referred in particular to carbon emissions-that directly affect climate change, which didn't include other GHGs (i. e. CH 4 , N 2 O, etc.). Where the subscript i is the various fuels in this case study, t means the time in years. C t represents total carbon emissions in year t (in million tons, Mt). E i t represents the total energy consumption of fuel type i in year t (in million tons, Mt), and NCV i is the net caloric value of fuel i. CC i t is the carbon content of the fuel type i, and O i is the oxidation rate of fuel i. The conversion factors, net caloric value, oxygenation efficiency and carbon content of the various fuels are listed in Table 4 .",
