    "text": "Supercritical fluid extraction of the volatile oil from Thymus vulgaris L. aerial parts and the correspondent composition was compared with those of the essential oil isolated by hydrodistillation. The main components in both cases were p-cymene, Î³-terpinene, linalool, thymol and carvacrol. The percentages changed according to the method of extraction used, nevertheless p-cymene and thymol dominated in both cases. The great difference was found to be the presence of thymoquinone in the volatile oil obtained through the supercritical fluid extraction. The presence of this component could be the responsible for the highest antioxidant activity assessed by Rancimat test, in which the lipidic substrate was sunflower oil [60] .",
