    "text": "One possible explanation for the multiple independent FPV introductions described here is that FPV viruses circulating in the feral cat population may occasionally spill over into domestic cats. In comparison to the owned cat population, estimated at 3.8 million [26] , some 2.1 to 6.3 million feral cats (free-roaming, unowned, unsocialised cats) inhabit Australia [27] . An FPV seroprevalence of 79% among feral cats in Victoria and NSW, documented in 1981, provides evidence of widespread FPV exposure [28] . Viral introductions could also have been anthropogenic, for example through fomite spread during international travel.",
