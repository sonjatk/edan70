    "text": "Forty ng of cDNA per reaction were used in the real time PCR using the ABI Prism® 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Foster City, CA). In the presence of Ampli-Taq Gold DNA polymerase (ABI Biosystems, Foster City, CA), the reaction was incubated for 2 min at 50°C followed by 10 min at 95°C. Then the reaction was run for 40 cycles at 15 s, 95°C and 1 min, 60°C per cycle (Table 1) . Assays-on-Demand™ primers and probes specific for the oxytocin receptor (Applied Biosystems; ID number Hs00168573-m1) were used in the PCR. GAPDH was measured and used to normalize all samples using the ΔΔCT method (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression of PDK1 is expressed relative to GAPDH and untreated samples in each stimulation study, respectively. At least three replicates were run for each condition.",
