    "text": "A similar approach was used in identifying the relevant articles. For each epidemic, the search terms included the name of the disease outbreak and the country of interest: BSARS AND Toronto,^BZika AND Brazil,^and BEbola AND Liberia.^It was vital that each search included the income setting to ensure that the findings were contextually relevant. These terms were then combined with the terms Bsociet*,^Bsociol*,^and Bpolitic*.^Truncation was used to ensure inclusion of all terms, including Bsociety,^Bsocietal,B sociological,^Bsociology,^Bpolitics,^Bpolitical,B politician,^and Bpoliticization.^The search terms must have Tables 2, 3, and 4 summarize the search results for the three outbreaks within the specified contexts. The titles and abstracts of the search results were reviewed for relevance to the politics of epidemics. All biomedical articles describing biomedical research were excluded. All articles that were relevant to the study topic were retrieved and reviewed. The initial review involved RA, grouping the search results according to the disease outbreak. For each outbreak, RA first scanned through a couple of papers, identifying the emerging themes. Once these were identified, subsequent reviews were structured along these themes, although an open stance was maintained throughout to enable the reviewer to identify any additional relevant themes.",
