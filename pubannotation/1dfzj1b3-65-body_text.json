    "text": "Seasonal qualitative and quantitative differences in composition and antioxidant activities of male and female leaf essential oils of Pistacia atlantica were observed. The main components of male leaf essential oil were α-pinene/α-thujene, spathulenol and bicyclogermacrene. The major component of female leaf essential oil was δ-3-carene. The seasonal variation showed that most of the main components of the oils reached theirs highest values in September. The highest antioxidant capacity to scavenge free DPPH radicals was reached in the month of June for male oils and during the months of September -October for the female oils. The high reducing power for male oil was detected during the month of June and for the female oil was in August. The antioxidant activity of the female oil was almost ten times higher than ascorbic acid in the FRAP assay [81] .",
