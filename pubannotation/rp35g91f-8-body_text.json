    "text": "First-pass assessment of gene function was obtained from the GeneCards database (www.genecards.org) (Safran et al. 2010 ) and a tissue expression profile was analyzed using the Fantom5 database (http://fantom. gsc.riken.jp/zenbu/) (Forrest et al. 2014; Severin et al. 2014) . The top 100 transcripts (mapping to 78 unique genes) that correlated with the pulmonary myocardium PCA trait were submitted for enrichment analyses and gene ontology (GO) using the WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit (WebGestalt) . This resource incorporates information from different public databases including the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), WikiPathways, and human phenotype ontology. We also used the oPOSSUM-3 Webbased tool (Kwon et al. 2012) to identify overrepresentation of transcription factor binding sites and integrated ChIP-seq data from two previously published data sets (Dupays et al. 2015; He et al. 2011) .",
