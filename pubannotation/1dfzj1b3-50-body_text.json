    "text": "The DPPH method was also the sole one used by [63] , although the authors also performed the DPPH method but coupled to TLC (thin layer chromatography), that allows determination of which compounds are resposnsible for antioxidant activity. Using two tests based on the same principle but using diverse methodologies (spectrophotometer and TLC), the authors were able to find the compounds responsible for such activities after separation by TLC. The authors identified 1,8-cineole and methyl eugenol as the components responsible for the moderate antioxidant activity of the essential oils of Myrtus communis L.. The same procedure was followed by other authors [64] for the oils of Aniba panurensis (Meisn.) Mez, Aniba rosaeodora Ducke and Licaria martiniana (Mez) Kostern., from Brazil. The IC 50 values were generally >1,000 μg/mL, substantially superior to that of quercetin, the reference used by the authors. Such low activity was attributed to the absence or to the very low concentrations of some compounds responsible for antioxidant activity -β-caryophyllene along with phenolic compounds. Once again, and as reported above, such results might be enough for the authors to decide not to do other assays.",
