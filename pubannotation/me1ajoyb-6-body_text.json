    "text": "The natural route of transmission among reservoir rodents is thought to be principally through aerosols and/or biting [27] . However, experiments have been equivocal in clarifying transmission mechanisms. Weanling bank voles caged with infected individuals lead to transmission as early as 14 days post exposure [14] . Similar experiments examining SNV transmission between deer mice have been less informative; however, in artificial enclosure experiments, transmission appeared to be facilitated by deer mice with higher amounts of viremia and wounding [8] and males likely play a dominant role in transmission in natural populations [9, 28, 29] . In bank voles, offspring of PUUV-infected dams were less likely to be infected after exiting the nest because of protective maternal antibody [30] . Although it is thought horizontal transmission is most important, work by Hutchinson et al. [31] showed that vertical transmission occurred among cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) infected with Black Creek Canal virus, so it is possible that both routes may influence transmission at the population level.",
