    "text": "Presently, stop codon readthrough in VEGFA (55) and PRF in PRRSV (19, this work) represent the only two examples of specific modulation of translational decoding (recoding) mediated by proteins. The participation of hnRNPs in each case may reflect the versatility of these proteins in linking sequence-specific nucleic acid binding with specific protein-protein interactions and serving as a fulcrum for multilateral molecular cross-talk (58) . It seems highly unlikely that protein-mediated recoding will be restricted to the two present examples, given the plethora of hnRNPs and other RNA binding proteins present in host and viral proteomes.",
