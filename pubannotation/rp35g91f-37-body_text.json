    "text": "The expression of calcium handling networks in the pulmonary myocardium are dysregulated in atrial fibrillation We chose to investigate the potential for genes involved in ion transport and calcium handling to be dysregulated in atrial fibrillation. We selected 16 genes which are known to be involved in regulation of ion transport, almost all of which are also known susceptibility genes for arrhythmia (Table 6) Wang et al. 1995) , and analyzed their expression in a publicly available mRNA microarray data set generated by Deshmukh et al. (2015) . This study used RNA extracted from left atrial appendage tissue obtained from cardiac surgery patients who were divided into three categories: those with atrial fibrillation who either were or were not in sinus rhythm at the time tissue samples were collected, and those with no history of atrial fibrillation. The patient cohorts represent susceptibility to atrial fibrillation and persistent atrial fibrillation, respectively, when compared to control samples with no history of atrial fibrillation (Deshmukh et al. 2015) . We compared our genes of interest (Table 6 ) to expression changes in this data set to determine if genes in our network are likely to be n Table 4 ChIP-seq enrichment of Nkx2-5, Srf, and Mef2a in genomic regions proximal to genes within the pulmonary myocardium gene network and candidate upstream regulators dysregulated in atrial fibrillation. Of these 16 genes, four were significantly downregulated (Cacna2d2, 0.5-fold; Kcnj5, 0.7-fold; Myoz2, 0.7fold; and Sln, 0.7-fold) and three were significantly upregulated (Atp2a2, 1.6-fold; Csrp3, 1.8-fold; and Gja3, 1.6-fold) in the persistent atrial fibrillation cohort compared to either the susceptibility or the control cohorts (Table 6) .",
