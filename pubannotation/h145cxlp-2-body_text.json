    "text": "In Germany, influenza sentinel surveillance on outpatients of all ages [17] confirmed that the first postpandemic season 2010/11 was dominated by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (62 %), co-circulating with influenza B (37 %) whereas A(H3N2) was rare (<1 %). During the second season 2011/12, A(H1N1)pdm09 was rare (1 %), whereas A(H3N2) was diagnosed in 75 % of cases and co-circulated with influenza B (24 %). In the third season 2012/13, all three types/subtypes co-circulated in similar proportions (34 % A(H1N1)pdm2009, 31 % A(H3N2), and 35 % B).",
