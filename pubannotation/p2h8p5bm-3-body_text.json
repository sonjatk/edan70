    "text": "There are general features that distinguish TBFV from mosquito-borne. One such feature is that tick-borne viruses tend to persist in certain stable foci whereas mosquito-borne viruses may suddenly emerge and they can rapidly spread to new areas and continents causing large epidemics [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Mosquito-borne flaviviruses are transmitted horizontally from mosquito to vertebrate to mosquito, and for some viruses, humans act as the amplifying host [12] [13] [14] . Mosquitoes have a short life compared to ticks, as it can take several years for a tick to develop from egg to adult [15] . Ticks also only take one blood meal at each of their life stages, larvae, nymph, and adult, this means that tick-borne viruses need to be maintained in infected ticks during a very long time [16] . Thus, replication in ticks needs to be lower compared to mosquitoes, which have higher viral turnover and a faster generation cycle, this also contributes to the high mutation rate in mosquito-borne flaviviruses, and relative stable genomes of TBFVs [17, 18] . Infection of tick-borne flaviviruses usually cause a short viremia in humans and larger vertebrates. This route of transmission has been described as less important in tick-borne flavivirus infection [19] , instead TBEV has been shown to be transmitted by viremic rodents and among co-feeding ticks without viremia [20] . Humans act as dead-end hosts since they do not produce high enough viremia to transmit the virus to new ticks.",
