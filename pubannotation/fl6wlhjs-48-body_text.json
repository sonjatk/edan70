Plots of the day-byday quantiles of the filtered radiograph counts attributable to an anthrax attack, based on 500 simulated anthrax outbreaks. The filtering operation, as defined by (3), is based on the first ten months of training data from Akron, in combination with one of four filters (1-day, 7-day, linear and exponential). Each filtered signal is scaled by τ k, 0.03 , calculated using a normal approximation, for comparisons to be made across filters. The biases in the specificity Figure 6 The biases in the specificity. A plot of the actual specificity (the specificity calculated using the training data) minus the nominal specificity (1 -α) for different values of α. The value of the detection threshold τ k,α , was calculated using a normal approximation. One minus the actual specificity",
