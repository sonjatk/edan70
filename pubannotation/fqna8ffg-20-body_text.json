    "text": "In the present study we first set out to define the time point of the onset of the cellular inflammatory response. BAL cell differentiation clearly indicated the main influx of PMNs into the alveolar airspace, to take place between 12 and 18 h after CNP IT, with the point of culmination around day 1 (Fig. 3) . The neutrophilic inflammation showed a transient nature, and was completely resolved till day 7, which matches well with the absence of any histological changes or signs of sizeable lung tissue injury, which otherwise would decelerate the resolution process. A distinct expression and release of neutrophil attracting CXCL chemokines, accompanied and preceded the inflammatory recruitment of PMNs, in a way that Cxcl1,-2 and-5 gene expression increased most rapidly from 6 h to 12 h after the particle challenge (Fig. 4b) and yielded highest cytokine concentrations around 12 to 18 h after treatment. The 12 h time point showed also the most prominent activation of the NF-kB1 pathway in lung homogenates, indicated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay analysis of the specific recognition sequence for NF-kB, and the maximal expression of the NF-kB responsive genes Nfkbib, and Nfkbiz (data not shown).",
