    "text": "To investigate the mechanism of lymphocyte activation following LDV infection we first analyzed the kinetics of CD69 upregulation on splenic lymphocytes at several time points following infection. CD69 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry as previously described [16] and became detectable at 14 hours post-infection, peaked at 16 to 24 hours, and returned almost to background levels by 72 hours ( Figure 1A ). The induction of CD69 occurred on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as B cells ( Figure 1B ). In addition to the spleen, CD69 upregulation was also observed, albeit to a lesser extent, on lymphocytes from the blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow ( Figure 1C ). In contrast, no significant upregulation was observed on lymphocytes from the thymus, which are primarily immature T cells. In contrast to CD69, the IL-2 receptor alpha chain (CD25), which is upregulated later in the activation cascade and is typically dependent on TCR ligation [21] , did not increase in expression during the first day of LDV infection (data not shown). This result is consistent with partial rather than full activation of the lymphocytes.",
