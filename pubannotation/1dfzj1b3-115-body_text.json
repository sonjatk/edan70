    "text": "In a short report, Chainy et al. (2000) [148] described that anethole, eugenol and isoeugenol inhibited TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in ML1-a cells. The same authors also reported that anethole inhibited the degradation of IκBα, blocking its phosphorylation in TNF-stimulated ML1-a cells. In the same cells and with TNF stimulation, anethole did not induce the phosphorylation of MAP kinase. Besides NF-κB and MAP kinase, anethole also blocked TNF-induced JNK and AP-1.",
