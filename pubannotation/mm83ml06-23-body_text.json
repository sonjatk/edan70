    "text": "To further analyze the potential antiretroviral activity of the DIs PR-619 and P22077, HLAC [62] , prepared from human tonsil tissue, were infected with HIV-1 NL4-3 . HLA cultures reflect the natural cell population of a lymphoid tissue and support productive HIV-1 replication independently of coreceptor tropism and without exogenous stimulation [52, 53] . Since the replication of HIV-1 in HLAC generally exhibits donor-dependent differences, the area under the curve (AUC), representing the replication capacity in each HLA culture, was determined to enable the comparison of results obtained in HLAC from different donors ( Figure  5A ,B,D,E,G,H,J,K). Evaluation of the replication profiles of untreated wt compared to structured treatment with PR-619 or P22077 in HLAC revealed a concentration-dependent reduction of the replication capacity in all settings, irrespective of treatment scheme or tropism of HIV-1 ( Figure  5A ,B,G,H). An even more dramatic effect on X4-and R5-tropic virus replication was observed under permanent treatment with 5 μM PR-619 ( Figure 5D ,E) or 7.5 μM P22077 ( Figure 5J ,K). Irrespective of treatment schemes, the highest inhibitor concentrations of 10 μM PR-619 or 15 μM P22077 almost completely blocked the replication capacity of X4-and R5-tropic viruses. In contrast, the USP7-specific DI P5091, which had no impact on Gag processing efficiency, did not reduce virus replication (data not shown). To exclude unspecific effects of P22077 and PR-619 on cell viability, water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST)-1 assays were performed. Structured treatment with inhibitor concentrations, which completely suppressed HIV-1 virus replication, had no impact on cell viability ( Figure 5C ,I). Permanent treatment merely led to a slight, stepwise decline in cell viability down to about 80% at the highest concentration of PR-619 or P22077 ( Figure 5F ,L). Altogether, these results demonstrate that DIs induce a concentration-dependent decline in replication capacity of HIV-1NL4-3, independently of tropism and treatment scheme, and without showing any toxic effects.
