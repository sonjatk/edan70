    "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was identified as a zoonotic virus, whose mode of transmission is from animals to humans. The origin of the virus is believed to be bats, from which it was then transferred to camels. Camels are currently regarded as a major host for MERS-CoV. It has also been identified as the most significant source for human infections [1] . The isolates of MERS-CoV from camels and humans have also been found to more than 99% identical [2] . While camels have been identified as the primary source of MERS-CoV infection through both indirect as well as direct contact, the specific route and role of camels in disease transmission is yet to be identified.",
