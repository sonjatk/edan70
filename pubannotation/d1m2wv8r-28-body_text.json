    "text": "General experimental design. CPV-HLJ-6 (GenBank accession no. KR611475.1) was passaged ten times in F81 cells, resulting in a final stock containing viruses at 10 5.5 TCID 50 /mL. For infection, 10 6 F81 cells were plated in 25 cm 2 culture flasks and, at the same time, inoculated by CPV at a MOI of 1. Infected cells were collected at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hpi, and uninfected mock-treated cells were collected at 0 and 48 h after plating. All experiments were repeated in three biological replicates with cells at different passage numbers.",
