    "text": "The etiology of KD is unknown [4, 21, 22] . However, there is a proposed relation to an infectious agent. Epidemiological evidence for this comes from the fact that there are seasonal peaks of KD during winter and spring months and outbreaks have been described [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Siblings have a higher rate of KD than the general population; usually cases are within the first year [29] , and can be as high as up to 50% of cases within 10 days of each other [30] . Recent studies show a lower incidence in breastfed infants [31] and KD is rare in both newborns and individuals over five years of age. This implies a maternally derived protective immunity to a ubiquitous infectious agent [32] . This phenomenon is similar to epidemiological findings with human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) infections. In fact, HHV-6 is one of several potential etiologies that have been proposed as the cause of KD [11, 16] . Other notable infectious agents include other Herpesviridae (Epstein Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus), human coronavirus (New Haven), retroviruses, Parvovirus B19, bocavirus, and bacterial infections such as staphylococci, streptococci, Bartonella, and Yersinia infections. Some of these agents have been independently associated with aneurysm formation [15] . Epstein Barr virus particularly is associated with coronary aneurysms [33] . Several non-infectious agents have also been proposed such as carpet shampoos, mercury and living near bodies of water [11, 16] . Additionally, the recent report of tropospheric wind patterns correlating with outbreaks in Japan would not be consistent with many of the viruses that have been proposed [21, 34, 35] . These reports imply a relationship to an environmental antigen, as either a priming or inciting event.",
