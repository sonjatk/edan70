    "text": "The CSFV NS5A comprises 497 amino acids and is a component of the replication complex. The conserved sequence C2717-C2740-C2742-C2767 in the NS5A protein has been proved to be important for viral growth and RNA synthesis [7] . It has been shown that NS5A regulates viral RNA replication through binding to NS5B (viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp] ) and 3 1 -UTR [8] . The NS5A protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV), another member of the family Flaviviridae, is an essential component of the replication complex [9] and plays a role in regulating cellular and viral mRNA translation [10, 11] . The HCV NS5A-Core interaction is critical for the subcellular localization of NS5A and the production of infectious virus [12] . The HCV NS5A also plays an essential role in the switch from genome replication to particle assembly [13, 14] . In addition, the CSFV NS5A decreases IRES-mediated translation in a dose-dependent manner and the key sites (K399, T401, E406 and L413) are also found in BVDV, BDV and HCV [15] . To date, studies have been focused on the roles of the CSFV NS5A protein in viral genomic replication and translation [8, 15] , but knowledge of NS5A-interacting host proteins and their impacts on CSFV replication is limited.",
