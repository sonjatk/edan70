    "text": "It seems likely that a subset of the foxes infected during 2009/10 were part of a fox-to-fox transmission cycle, with limited skunk-tofox transmission occurring as well. This is supported by the fact Although relatively few amino acid changes were associated with the 2003/10 host jump, it is possible that one or more of these changes may have been required for efficient transmission of the virus in the local gray fox population. Despite an extensive search of the rabies virus literature, none of these amino acid changes were described by other studies as being associated with a change in viral phenotype. Transmission studies using reverse genetics are required to identify which genetic changes are responsible for increased transmissibility. Information from this type of analysis may provide important information on the risk of a similar host jump occurring in other regions, including regions where gray foxes overlap with populations of mesocarnivores that have threatened or endangered status.",
