For instance, the nonstructural protein NS5A from Hepatitis C virus that colocalizes and can be coimmunoprecipitated with LC3 proteins when ectopically expressed in various hepatoma cell lines. 59, 76, 77 Also, the viral peptide 2BC and the protein 3A encoded by the genome polyprotein from Poliovirus type 1 interact with LC3-II. 60, 78 All these proteins contain WxxL motifs.",
