    "text": "The findings of this study revealed that nurses do not receive personal psychological support. Even though the support structure is there in the hospital, their needs are not considered and attended to. A study by Mametja [16] reported concerns that were raised by nurses, that they needed counselling, not only when they have contracted the disease, but for them to cope with the demands of the high number of patients who no longer recover from the illness, but die as the result of HIV/AIDS. The findings of the present study agree with those of the study by Arjun [25] , which concluded that nurses caring for MDR-TB patients did not receive psychological support from the clinical psychologists when they need it; neither was there a functional employee assistance programme available at the institution.",
