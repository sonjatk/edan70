    "text": "The exclusion criterions for cases were presence of wheezing at auscultation, or minors whose parents or legal guardian declined to sign the informed consent statement. Controls were patients hospitalized for surgery or in a routine outpatient practice environment, aged between 2 and 59 months, without any symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness; suspicion of infection of other site was not an exclusion criteria. Cases and controls were matched for age (±1 year) and calendar date of hospital admission (±1 month) to take seasonality into account. Thus, 61% of patients were recruited during the rainy season (May to October) while 39% were recruited during the dry season (November to April).",
