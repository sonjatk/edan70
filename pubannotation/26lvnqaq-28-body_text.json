    "text": "Organ samples were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 48 h, routinely processed for histology and 4-Î¼m sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE). The infundibulum, magnum and uterus were examined for the presence of: (a) heterophilic infiltrate; (b) lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltrate; (c) the presence of hemorrhage and/or edema; (d) necrosis; (e) the presence of hemorrhage and/or cell debris within the lumen. For each of these pathological features, a score was given as follows: 0 absence of the feature, 1 mild, 2 moderate, 3 severe. For each section scores were averaged to obtain a mean histopathology score. Mean scores were averaged for each oviduct section and sampling time.",
