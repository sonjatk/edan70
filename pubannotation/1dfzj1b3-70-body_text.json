    "text": "The ability to scavenge hydroxyl radicals of the essential oils of Thymus marschallianus and Thymus proximus were evaluated using the safranine method and the authors reported that the latter oil was more effective than the former. The activity of both oils were dose-dependent and they were mainly constituted by thymol, p-cymene and Î³-terpinene [54] . Patil et al. (2010) [51] have compared two methods (deoxyribose and benzoic acid) on the hydroxyl radical scavenging ability of Ageratum conyzoides, mainly constituted by the phenolic chromenes precocene I and precocene II, and they obtained different responses according to the method used. In the benzoic acid hydroxylation method, the essential oil presented better activity than in the deoxyribose method. The authors explained such results to the relative reactivity of hydroxyl radical towards the substrates deoxyribose and benzoic acid.",
