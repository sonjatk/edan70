    "text": "We conducted the largest prospective epidemiological assessment of risk factors of S. suis infection globally. In addition to the previously suggested risk factors, occupational exposure and contact with pigs or pork without skin protection, we identified the ingestion of food with a high risk of contamination with S. suis serotype 2 to be an important risk factor for S. suis meningitis. To investigate eating habits as a risk factor of S. suis infection, we focused on potential ''high risk'' dishes common in Vietnam. These include fresh or under-cooked blood, tonsils, tongue, stomach, intestines and uterus. Such food items typically are undercooked when eaten as a main dish (as opposed to as components of well cooked main dishes such as rice or noodle soups), as was generally the case in our patients. By multivariate analysis, we demonstrated that eating these ''high risk'' dishes in the 2 weeks prior to admission was a significant risk factor for this infection. Eating habits were also confirmed as a risk factor during a relatively small S. suis outbreak in Thailand, associated with consumption of fresh pig blood. [12] . Eating pork was not associated with S. suis cases in a matched case-control study conducted during the outbreak in Sichuan province in 2005 [13] . S. suis lives as normal flora in the respiratory, gastrointestinal and genital tract of pigs and can cause invasive disease in 0 . 0 9 9 ---- (1) Crude OR based on logistic (hospital controls) or conditional logistic regression (community controls). (2) Adjusted for age, sex and rural/urban residence, using logistic regression. (3) Adjusted for sex (matched for age and residence), using conditional logistic regression. (4) Only individuals with pigs at home were analyzed. OR could not be analyzed for community controls because none of them reported ill pigs at home. (5) Only individuals who had pig swab samples at their houses were analyzed. OR could not be analyzed for community controls because there was no discordant pairs included in the analysis. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0017604.t005 pigs. S. suis was isolated from raw pork samples obtained from markets in Hong Kong [14] . There may be a high bacterial load in food items that are kept at high ambient temperatures. Therefore, patients may be infected with S. suis through gastrointestinal tract if the ''high risk'' dishes are served as raw or under-cooked food.",
