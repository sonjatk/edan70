    "text": "A role for PRRSV nsp1␤ protein in PRF was the first description of a protein trans-activator of this process (19) . Here, we show that the active frameshift-stimulatory element in fact comprises a complex of viral nsp1␤ and a cellular poly(C) binding protein. PCBPs have been shown to regulate gene expression at multiple levels, including transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA stabilization and translation (reviewed in Refs. 25, 26) . Hitherto, a role for PCBPs in protein synthesis has been limited to translation initiation, mostly in the recruitment of ribosomes to viral IRESes (see Ref. 40) . Their activity in stimulating PRF in PRRSV is the first example of a role for PCBPs in modulating translational elongation.",
