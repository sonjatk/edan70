    "text": "In pneumonia cases, S. pneumoniae was positive in 16 (13.6%) patients, S. aureus in 6 (5.1%) patients and H. influenza in 5 (4.2%) patients by PCR blood sample detection. Most patients with S. pneumoniae detection by PCR had also S. pneumoniae nasal carriage (93.5%, 15/16), while only 17.6% (15/85) of patients with S. pneumoniae nasal carriage had positive detection by PCR (P = 0.04). Concordance of serotype 1 detected in nasal swabs and blood in pneumonia cases was high (Îº = 0.70, P<0.001). Coronavirus 63 was identified from pleural effusion in 1 patient. Microbiological findings, including S. pneumoniae serotypes distribution, from PCR nasal swab or blood sample were not different in pneumonia cases according to the result of urine antibiotic testing (data not shown). Blood culture was positive in 36 (30.5%) pneumonia cases; most microorganisms were probably related to contamination of samples. The following bacteria were detected: coagulase-negative staphyloccoci (n = 26), Salmonella spp. (n = 3), Gram-positive bacilli (n = 2), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1), Aerococcus viridans (n = 1), Enterococcus faecium (n = 1), Granulicatella elegans (n = 1), and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1).",
