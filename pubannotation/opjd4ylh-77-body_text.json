    "text": "Good infection control and prevention in the healthcare settings reduce the risk of contracting TB infection. TB settings should have the following TB infection control and prevention measures: workplace and administrative control measures, environmental control measures, and personal control measures. People who work or receive care in healthcare settings are at higher risk of being infected by TB. Therefore, it is necessary to have a TB infection control plan. Healthcare facilities should design policies and procedures for TB control. It should be reviewed periodically and evaluated for effectiveness to determine the actions necessary to minimize the risk for transmission of TB.",
