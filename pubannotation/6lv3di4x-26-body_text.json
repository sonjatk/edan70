After washing and removal of fat and connective tissue, the epithelium was treated with 0.1% protease (mass/volume [m/v]; from Streptomyces griseus type XIV; Sigma) and desoxyribonuclease I (0.001% m/v; from bovine pancreas; Sigma) for release of epithelial cells. After 48 h the cells were harvested by gently scratching the apical surface and washed twice with PBS Ϫ/Ϫ . Between the washing steps, the cells were passed through a 100-m cell strainer (Becton, Dickinson). Then 2 ϫ 10 6 cells were seeded in T75 tissue culture flasks coated with collagen types I and III (VitroCol; Sigma), in 25 ml of bronchial epithelial cell serum-free growth medium (BEGM; LHC basal medium supplemented; Thermo Fisher) supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF, 25 ng/ml; Thermo Fisher) and retinoic acid (50 nM; Sigma) and incubated at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . The medium was changed after 24 h and then every 2 to 3 days until confluence was reached. Cells were detached using trypsin (Sigma) and frozen in liquid nitrogen with 40% FBS and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Glutamax and without phenol red (DMEM; Gibco, Thermo Fisher) at 2.5 ϫ 10 6 cells per tube. For ALI cultures, 12-well inserts with a pore size of 0.4 m (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) were coated with collagen type IV (Sigma), and 2 ϫ 10 5 cells per insert were seeded in 500 l of BEGM (EGF, 25 ng/ml; Thermo Fisher) and 1 ml in the lower chamber, and cells were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO 2 . After 24 h, the insert medium was replaced, and then the medium in both chambers was changed every 2 to 3 days. After reaching confluence, the cells were shifted to ALI by removing the medium in the upper chamber, and in the basal chamber BEGM was replaced with ALI medium (1:1 [vol/vol] LHC basal medium plus DMEM, supplemented as BEGM with 1 ng/ml of EGF; Thermo Fisher). Experiments were performed as soon as movement of cilia was visible, indicating full differentiation of cultures.",
