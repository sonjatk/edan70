    "text": "HEK293T cells grown in 6-well plates (Nunc, Waltham, MA, USA) were cotransfected with 5 µg of pMyc-eEF1A and 3 µg of p3ˆFlag-NS5A using an X-tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent (catalog no. 06366236001; Roche, Penzberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were transfected with 400 µL of serum-free DMEM containing 8 µg of plasmids and 12 µL of X-tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent. At 6 h post-transfection (hpt), the transfection mixture was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated for an additional 48 h before being assayed.",
