    "text": "To ensure that the muscle-related transcripts that we had identified were indeed associated with the pulmonary myocardium and not the smooth muscle present in small arteries and surrounding the bronchus, we performed correlation analysis using Acta2. The top 100 transcripts correlated with Acta2 were enriched for smooth muscle-associated genes [including gamma-actin 2 (Actg2), leiomodin (Lmod2), transgelin (Tagln), and calponin 1 (Cnn1)], and did not significantly overlap with Tnni3-correlated transcripts (Table S2 in File S2).",
