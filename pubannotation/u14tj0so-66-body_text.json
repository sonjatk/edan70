    "text": "Since prediction of pseudoknotted structures are of interest to us, we only report running time comparison on pseudoknotted structures of our HK-PK data set. Figure 3 presents result of time comparison between Iterative HFold and HotKnots in a log plot (when log is in base 10). The X axis shows log(time) for HotKnots data points and the Y axis shows log(time) for Iterative HFold on the HK-PK data set. RNA sequences in this data set are between 26 and 400 bases long. HFold runs significantly faster than HotKnots and finishes under 1.5 seconds for even the longest RNA sequence in our data set (400 bases). HotKnots is faster than Iterative HFold on sequences of up to 47 bases, where Iterative HFold starts being faster than HotKnots. Iterative HFold runs in less than 8.3 seconds for all RNA sequences in this data set whereas HotKnots runs for over 6000 seconds (about 1.7 hours) on the longest RNA sequence in our data set. information about performance of each method see Additional file 4.",
