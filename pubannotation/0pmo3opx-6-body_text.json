    "text": "To determine the substrate specificity of APN, recombinant human APN (hAPN) was profiled using an unbiased and global substrate profiling approach referred to as Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS) 16 . The MSP-MS assay uses a 228-member library of 14-mer synthetic and unmodified peptide substrates that were rationally designed to maximize physicochemical diversity within a small sequence space 17 . For specificity determination, hAPN was incubated with the MSP-MS peptide library and time-dependent peptide cleavage products were identified with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Statistical analysis that considers both cleaved and uncleaved positions in the peptide library 18 was subsequently performed to construct an iceLogo representation of hAPN P1-P4â€² specificity as well as a corresponding heat map based on comprehensive Z-scores for each position (Fig. 1A ,B, and Supplemental Figure 1 ).",
