    "text": "H 2 treatment suppressed LPS-induced activation in primary cultured astrocyte. Because the over-activation of immune cells, including astrocytes, could have an adverse effect on neurons with the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines 34 , we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of H 2 on astrocyte using primary cultured astrocyte. As shown in Fig. 5 , stimulation of astrocytes with LPS for three hours led to marked increases in tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) (p < 0.001), interleukin (IL)-1β (p < 0.001), and IL-6 (p < 0.001) mRNA expression. These increases in expression of TNF-α (p < 0.01), IL-1β (p < 0.001) and IL-6 (p < 0.05) were significantly attenuated by H 2 treatment. Altered gene expression patterns in primary cultured astrocytes from the Control group, the LPS group, and the HW + LPS group. As we previously described the gene expression profile of microglia 12 , differential gene expression patterns of astrocytes from newborn mice in the Control group, the LPS group, and the HW + LPS group were also observed (Tables S1-S4, Supplementary Information). These results suggest that H 2 might also influence the function not only of microglia but also of astrocytes via changes in gene expression.",
