    "text": "The tissue samples used in this study were obtained from the archived collection of California Department of Public Health, Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory (CDPH-VRDL). Gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) displaying symptoms of rabies were submitted for rabies testing in the Humboldt Co. Public Health Laboratory between March 2009 and January 2010. Brain tissue samples that were laboratory confirmed to be infected with rabies virus were forwarded to CDPH-VRDL for genetic characterization. Other earlier skunk and fox tissue samples from Humboldt Co. were also available from the CDPH-VRDL archives. As part of routine rabies surveillance in California, the VRDL genotypes rabies-positive samples received from local public health laboratories by RT-PCR and performs sequence analysis on RT-PCR products using forward primer 1066 deg 59-GARAGAAGATTCTTCAGRGA-39 and reverse primer 304 targeting a portion of the nucleoprotein (N) gene as described in Trimarchi and Smith (2002) and Velasco-Villa, et al. (2006) [13] [14] [15] . Approximately 1 gram of brain tissue from foxes and skunks infected with the California skunk rabies virus variant were placed in TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sent to LLNL for further analysis. RNA was extracted from the tissue sample following the manufacturer's protocol.",
