    "text": "Children with physician diagnosed, persistent wheezing unresponsive to ICS therapy, who underwent FOB + BAL between January 2005 and December 2007 were included. As a tertiary referral centre, we are referred children for further evaluation and treatment of persistent wheezing despite ICS treatment and anti-reflux therapy in those with demonstrated GERD. Our initial assessment includes a detailed history of disease, symptoms, signs and treatment adherence, a check for the appropriateness of treatment administration and dosage, and a thorough physical examination. In children without any apparent explanation for persistent wheezing, a work-up, including FOB + BAL is conducted. In these cases, FOB + BAL is always performed under stable condition, outside episodes of acute infection or exacerbation of respiratory symptoms.",
