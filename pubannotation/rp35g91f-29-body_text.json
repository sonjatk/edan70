    "text": "The transcription factors NKX2-5, SRF, MEF2A, TEAD1, and NR2F1 potentially cooperate to specify and/or maintain pulmonary myocardium identity Since NKX2-5 has previously been shown to be important for the maintenance of pulmonary myocardium cell identity, we investigated the possibility that genes within the pulmonary myocardium, and the candidate upstream regulators, might be direct targets of NKX2-5. To this end, we interrogated previously published NKX2-5 ChIP-seq data derived from two sources. He et al. (2011) used a doxycycline-inducible dual adenovirus system to express biotinylated NKX2-5 in the HL1 cardiomyocyte cell line, while Dupays et al. (2015) examined endogenous NKX2-5 binding in mouse hearts at embryonic day 11.5.",
