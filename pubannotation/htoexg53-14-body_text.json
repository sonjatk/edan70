    "text": "For T cell immune monitoring, we identified 101 individual synthetic peptides (assigned as 1 to 101) in silico spanning the entire MERS-CoV N protein sequence (Human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012, GenBank accession no. JX869059). This peptide library was designed to contain 15-mer peptides overlapping by 11 aa. Eighty-four peptides could be synthesized (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and were organized into two-dimensional matrix peptide pools (V1 to V9 and H1 to H9) containing 9 or 10 peptides as described previously [47, 48] . For further T cell epitope mapping, the 11 aa sequence shared between peptide #89 and #90 was trimmed into 8-10-mer peptides, which were also obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific. All peptides were dissolved in PBS to a concentration of 2 mg/mL and stored at −20 • C until use.",
