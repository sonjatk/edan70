    "text": "Viral and bacterial sialidases have been focused on as drug targets for the treatment of human infections (Soong et al., 2006; Memoli et al., 2008) . Viral sialidases are critically required for viral propagation because they are required for release from the host cell . Drug discovery of inhibitors targeting sialidase has focused on either synthetic compounds through random screening or substrate (N-acetylneuraminic acid) mimics. However, these studies have mainly been targeted against sialidase from the influenza virus. There are several inhibitors that mimic the substrate, including zanamivir (Relenza), oseltamivir (Tamiflu; a cyclohexene derivative), peramivir (a cyclopentane-based inhibitor) and A-315675 (a pyrrolidine-based inhibitor; Kim et al., 2013) . All of these compounds are based on 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-Nacetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac2en), a putative transitionstate analogue. At present, the existence of drug-resistant strains against zanamivir (Gubareva et al., 1998) , oseltamivir (Gubareva et al., 2001) and other antivirals (Tambić Andrasević, 2004) have spurred on the need to discover innovative antiviral agents.",
