    "text": "In comparison to ODN of other groups, CpG-A have been used in much fewer studies concerning innate antiviral responses. This is most likely the result of the more time consuming and costly manufacturing process of these molecules linked to the synthesis of the flanking poly (G) strings necessary for optimal immune effects [31] . Also, CpG-A exhibit only weak stimulation of B cells, which produce antibodies that are valuable in later antiviral responses. Stability of CpG-A in vivo has also been questioned due to the only partial phosphorothioate backbone of these molecules. This can be partially compensated however, by the formation, through association of their poly (G) stretches, of highly ordered Gtetrad structures with enhanced stability [12] . Their smaller content in synthetic backbones could moreover help reduce possible long-term side effects [79, 80] . Most importantly, CpG-A remain the most potent inducers of type I IFN, themselves the most biologically active antiviral molecules known to date [19] . With regard to this, a recombinant feline type I IFN marketed in both Japan (Intercat ® ) and Europe (Virbagen Omega ® ) has made its way into therapeutic protocols for FCV, FHV, FeLV and canine parvovirus infections [67, [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] and has demonstrated preventive capacities in a cattery developing an outbreak of FPV [87] . However, when compared to direct initiation of antiviral mechanisms by a recombinant IFNα protein, administration of CpG ODN holds the advantage of inducing the production of all type I IFN and their subtypes, which have been shown to possess differential antiviral properties and kinetics [88] . Our data demonstrate that five viral species belonging to the Calicivirus, Herpesvirus, Parvovirus, Coronavirus and Retrovirus families were highly sensitive to the immunologic effects of ODN 2216 in feline cells. Strength and breadth of antiviral defense mechanisms induced in vivo by this molecule have the potential to outweigh those observed with recombinant IFN.",
