    "text": "Commonly used examples of the filter {a l } include the differencing, moving average, or exponential filter. For a fixed value of α, let 1 -α denote the specificity (the probability of no detection, when there is no actual outbreak signature). We declare evidence of an outbreak signature at time t if the detection process at that time point, D k,t , exceeds a threshold τ k,α , calculated using the data or the process. Further details are given in the Appendix. Filter plots Figure 2 Filter plots. Plots of the four filters {f k, l } that can be used to calculate the detection process D k, t for the Columbus series. The number in parentheses after the filter name is τ k, α , calculated using a normal approximation. 2. When {a l } is the 7-day filter, {f k,l } is a weighted average of the last 7 days (with most weight on the current day), minus a weighted decaying average of the remaining past days. The weekly seasonal terms are not as strong, compared to the filter that is the convolution of the 1-day filter.",
