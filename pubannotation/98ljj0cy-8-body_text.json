    "text": "This study evaluated 350 banked serum samples collected in July 2012 from individuals with self-reported domestic animal exposure and controls in Jazan Region, KSA, for the presence of MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies. None of the specimens tested positive using the MERS-S ppNT assay. Our negative results suggest population naivety to MERS-CoV infection in this region of KSA 1 month after the first earliest case was reported in another region of the country. 8 At the time samples were collected, there was no known evidence of human or animal infections with MERS-CoV from the Jazan region. 4 Since then multiple humans in Jazan have developed MERS-CoV infections.",
