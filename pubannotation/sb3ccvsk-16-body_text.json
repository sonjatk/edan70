    "text": "Increased T cell numbers and activation within CLN after Foxp3 + Treg depletion, but no differences in the CNS, implicated impaired T cell trafficking. Following JHMV infection, T cell migration to the CNS is regulated by CXCR3, as well as CCR2 and CCR5 (33) (34) (35) . However, expression of their respective ligands, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, and CCL5 was not affected by Foxp3 + Treg ablation within brain or spinal cord ( Figure 6A) . However, Foxp3 + Tregs have been reported to limit inflammatory chemokine expression within draining lymph nodes, thereby promoting T cell egress (36) . Elevated T cell activation and IFN-γ mRNA in CLN were indeed associated with significantly increased levels of IFN-γ inducible CXCL9 and CXCL10 mRNA levels in CLN of Foxp3 + Treg depleted DTR + mice (Figure 6B) . Similarly, CXCR3 expression on CD4 + T cells was upregulated in CLN ( Figure 6C ). By contrast, there were no differences in CCL2 and CCL5 mRNA expression (Figure 6B) , indicating a preferential increase of IFN-γ regulated chemokines (37, 38) . These results supported the notion that enhanced and/or prolonged interaction of CXCR3 ligand expressing APC with CXCR3 + T cells may promote retention, thereby limiting T cell egress into circulation (39) . Overall, these results indicate that Foxp3 + Tregs mediate suppressive function primarily within CLN and are more potent at controlling peripheral SR T cell activation than virus-specific T cells during chronic JHMV infection. reduced Tr1 cell response correlates with increased cns sr T cells Unaltered SR T cell responses within the CNS of DT-treated DTR + mice indicated a Foxp3-independent component regulating the CNS autoimmune response during chronic JHMV infection. In addition to Foxp3 + Tregs, IL-10-producing Tr1 cells also regulate autoimmune responses, including during MS (40, 41) . Tr1 cells are drastically reduced in JHMV-infected mice deficient in IL-27 signaling, a cytokine promoting Tr1 cell response (15) . Analysis of IL-27R −/− mice further demonstrated that IL-27 does not play a pro-inflammatory role or significantly alter CD8 T cell function during JHMV infection but is rather a major regulator of the Tr1 response (15) . Myelin-specific CD4 + T cell responses were therefore compared in infected WT and IL-27R −/− mice at d30 p.i., the peak of the SR T cell response (13) . Opposing the results in Foxp3 + Treg depleted mice, frequencies and numbers of both virus-and myelin-specific CD4 + T cells were similar within CLN of IL-27R −/− mice compared to controls ( Figure 7A) . Furthermore, frequencies of both virus-specific and SR CD4 + T cells were significantly increased within the CNS of IL-27R −/− mice compared to WT mice ( Figure 7B) . Interestingly, alteration of CD4 + T cell frequencies in the absence of Tr1 cells was more prominent for myelin-specific compared to virus-specific T cells (fivefold versus twofold, respectively), indicating preferential action on SR T cells. Moreover, despite similar overall inflammatory cell numbers, numbers of virus and SR CD4 + T cells were increased in the absence of Tr1 cells ( Figure 7B ). Tr1 cells thus do not appear to regulate peripheral SR CD4 + T cell responses but act preferentially within the CNS during chronic JHMV infection. These data indicate that regulation of SR CD4 + T cell response during chronic JHMV infection is dependent upon Tr1 cells within the CNS, contrasting the specific role of Foxp3 + Tregs within CLN.",
