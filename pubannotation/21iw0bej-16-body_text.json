    "text": "To determine whether viral replication and production also is elevated at other phases of the cell cycle, the effect of S phase synchronization was assessed. The cells were cultured in medium or were synchronized in S phase by culture with 0.85 mM thymidine for 24 h. Then, the cells were mock infected or were infected with 0.8 MOI of EV-D68 for 2 h, and fresh culture medium or 0.85 mM thymidine was added for another 24 h ( Figure 1E ). Thymidine induced obvious S phase arrest (P < 0.001; Figure 1F) . The genomic RNA level remained similar in S phase-synchronized cells and control non-synchronized cells at 2 h post-infection ( Figure 1M ) and at 24 h post-infection (P > 0.05; Figure 1G ). Furthermore, the TCID50/mL values at 24 h post-infection were equivalent for the S phase-synchronized cell supernatant (2.59 ± 1.37 × 10 5 ) and the control cell supernatant (3.28 ± 1.80 × 10 5 ) (P > 0.05; Figure 1H ). These results suggest that S-phase arrest does not affect EV-D68 viral entry, replication or production.",
