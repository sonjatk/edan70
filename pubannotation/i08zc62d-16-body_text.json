    "text": "Although the overall structure of Cp-NanI CD in complex with diplacone is similar to those of the apo enzyme and the complex with Neu5Ac, there are interesting structural differences between the apo enzyme and the complexes with Neu5Ac and diplacone that provide useful information regarding the development of natural geranylated flavonoid-based synthetic inhibitors (Fig. 3b) . Asp291 in the diplacone and Neu5Ac complexes, which is a mechanistically important acid/base catalyst (Crennell et al., 1993) , rotates by approximately 120 compared with the apo structure to make a hydrogen bond to the 3 0 -hydroxyl of diplacone or the 4 0 -hydroxyl of Neu5Ac. Moreover, the rotation of Asp291 also induces a conformational change of Ile327 in the apo enzyme compared with both complexes. Relative to the diplaconebound complex, in the Neu5Ac-bound complex Ile327 moves to make a suitable hydrophobic interaction with the -carbon of Asp291 and the 5 0 -acetamide moiety of the Neu5Ac molecule. Apo Cp-NanI CD and the diplacone complex showed a hydrogen-bond interaction mediated by one water molecule (W1), the position of which nearly overlaps with the 4 0 -hydroxyl group of Neu5Ac. On the other hand, the hydrogen bond between Asp328 and the 4 0 -hydroxyl group of The Cp-NanI catalytic site with diplacone. (a) Overall structure of the Cp-NanI catalytic domain bound to diplacone. (b) Details of the mode of binding. Diplacone and three water molecules (W1, W2 and W3) are shown as green sticks and red spheres, respectively. Hydrogen bonds are displayed as dashed lines.",
