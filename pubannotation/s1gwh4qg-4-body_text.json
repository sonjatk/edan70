    "text": "Identifiers (ID) composed of alphanumeric and other symbols are commonly used for tagging protein and nucleotide sequences and associated annotation in Gen-Bank [1], UniProt [2] , and other sources that either use these sequences or deal with molecular properties of associated biological entities (Table 1) . For instance in Uni-Prot, the primary accession number is the sole UID. In GenBank three fields, locus, accession and version, carry four different IDs, but only gi number (known also as primary ID) and accession number combined with version form unique IDs (UIDs). Each UID is assigned to a single entry. In contrast, a particular non-unique ID may be found in numerous entries. The UIDs ensure efficient computer-mediated data storage, maintenance and processing. To facilitate data mapping and transfer between different databases, in which ID inter-conversion plays important part, several specialized resources including GoMiner [3] , ErmineJ [4] , SOURCE [5] , RESOURCERER [6] ; IDconverter and IDClight [7] , and DAVID [8] have been developed.",
