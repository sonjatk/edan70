    "text": "We first considered rescaling the network formed by the node sampling methods in a similar way to that for the RMS method. We used the average weighted-degree of the sampled nodes kw sampled l ¼ 1=N S P i[S P j (a ij þ a ji ) to estimate the total weight of the original networkW original ¼ kw sampled lN=2, and rescale the network as in equation (2.1) but using the estimate for the total weight of the original network. However, as shown in electronic supplementary material, figure S6 , these scaled networks result in significant overpredictions of epidemic size, particularly when small percentages of the nodes are sampled. For the remainder of this paper, we therefore use the unscaled versions of the node sampling methods.",
