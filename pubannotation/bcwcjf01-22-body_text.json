    "text": "Among the 11 inversion loci, 6 were found in G, 2 found M and 1 in each of N, P and L. Two pairs of inversion loci, (4593, 4596) Data from Illumina sequencing were used to test the hypothesis that sub-consensus variants that were later enriched to become consensus could be detected at higher frequencies in the historical samples than those sub-consensus variants that did not. Loci shown in Figure 5 where inversion of the dominant and minor variants occurred between the historical and later samples are referred to as ''inversion sites''. The frequencies of sub-consensus variants at the inversion sites were compared to that of variants at non-inversion sites present in the 1995 samples (but not enriched to the consensus level in the 2003/10 samples) to determine if those variants at inversion sites were present in higher numbers in the pre-outbreak samples. The average frequency of sub-consensus variants at inversion sites was slightly but significantly higher than that of sub-consensus variants at non-inversion sites (p = 0.03, twosample t-test one-tailed). Samples of individuals from relatively early in the outbreak (prior to July1, 2009) had increased likelihood to have the 1995 consensus haplotype detected at the inversion sites as a sub-consensus mutation, although the difference fell short of statistical significance (p = 0.08).",
