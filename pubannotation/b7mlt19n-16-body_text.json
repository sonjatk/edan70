    "text": "We observed that 7% of the reviewed sequences that contains at least one putative LIR motif correspond to the genome polyprotein from various viruses. Because polyproteins are processed co-and post-translationally by both host and viral proteases, we ran a systematic PubMed search with the terms 'name of the virus C autophagy' followed by 'name of the virus C LC3' to restrain the result outcome as necessary, finally we looked for papers (excluding reviews and commentaries) that specifically mention proteins derived from the processing of the viral genome polyprotein.",
