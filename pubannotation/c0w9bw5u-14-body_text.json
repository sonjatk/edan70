    "text": "Given that the M proteins of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were capable of antagonizing IFN production through highly similar Innate immunosuppression by MERS-CoV M protein P-Y Lui et al mechanisms, 30 it will be of interest to analyze the sequence and domain architecture of the two proteins. Sequence alignment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV M proteins revealed a strikingly high sequence similarity (470%) and the presence of three transmembrane domains at the N-termini ( Figure 5A ). According to the prediction results, we have initially constructed two truncation mutants for MERS-CoV M protein, an N-terminal transmembrane domain-containing mutant and a C-terminal mutant, and tested their inhibitory capacity in suppressing IFN-Î² expression using a luciferase reporter assay. However, neither exhibited an inhibitory effect (data not shown), possibly due to unstable expression or aberrant localization.",
