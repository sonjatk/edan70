    "text": "Similarly, 60 hpi was the optimal time point to analyse the DEPs involved in the regulation of apoptosis because apoptosis-related proteins accounted for the largest percentage at this time point (Fig. 3e) , and the CPEs were the most serious at 60 hpi (Fig. 1b) . As shown in Fig. 4b , many proteins related to cell apoptosis were enriched in cluster A, and they were up-regulated during the entire infection period, but most strikingly at 48 and 60 hpi. Thus, we concluded that the late stage of CPV infection was a better time to investigate the CPV-induced F81 cell apoptosis process. As apoptosis may be the main mechanism utilised by viral oncolytic therapy, these identified DEPs may be useful for detailed studies in the future.",
