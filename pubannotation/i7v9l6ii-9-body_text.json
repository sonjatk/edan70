    "text": "Once control bands were identified, the sample was subjected to further analysis based on the virusspecific size of the amplicon. In case of influenza A H1N1 09 ('swine flu') serotype, in addition to human housekeeping gene control fragments, the presence of the influenza A generic PCR fragment as well as the H1N1 general signal was required to mark a sample as positive for H1N1 RNA. The detected 'swine flu' positive samples were subjected to sequencing by cloning and subsequent sequencing for matrix (GU322021.1, NCBI), neuraminidase (GU361110.1, NCBI) and hemagglutinin (GU727573.1, NCBI) genes to confirm viral diagnosis.
