    "text": "Vero cells were cultured on 6-well plates (Nunc). Ten-fold serial dilution of the virus samples was prepared in serum-free DMEM media. Each dilution (100 ml) was used to infect Vero cells in duplicate. The virus was allowed to adsorb at 37uC for 1 hr. After 48 hr incubation, the Vero cells were rinsed twice with PBS and stained with crystal violet solution for 5 min. The plates were washed with ddH 2 O and the virus titer was calculated. This plaque analysis included four biological and three technical replicates. Each cell line was infected by virus four times and the numbers of plaques on Vero cells were counted three times, respectively, by using the culture media containing viruses. [48] . Prepared chromatin DNA and naked DNA were treated with 3D8 scFv and DNase I (10610 24 U/ml and 8.3610 24 U/ml, respectively). The DNA samples were harvested after 0, 1, 2, and 3 hr of incubation and then each DNA sample was analyzed on an agarose gel for abzyme analysis. The relative quantification of DNA was measured by the height values and performed using GeneSnap 7.09 software (SynGene, UK).",
