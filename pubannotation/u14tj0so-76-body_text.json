    "text": "In this work we present Iterative HFold, a fast and robust iterative algorithm that matches the accuracy of the best existing pseudoknot prediction methods. Iterative HFold is significantly more accurate than IPknot while matching the accuracy of HotKnots on the HK-PK data set. Iterative HFold is superior to both IPknot and HotKnots on the IP-pk168 data set. Moreover both Iterative HFold and IPknot use less memory and run much faster than HotKnots on long sequences.",
