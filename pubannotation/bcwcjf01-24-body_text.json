    "text": "Although rabies virus has jumped species multiple times in the past [5, 8, 9, 25] , the event is relatively rare and deep genome sequence analysis has never been applied to examine the role of Table 1 . Consensus-level mutations found in 5 coding and 4 non-coding regions of the rabies genome. Table 2 . Amino acid changes according to genomic position, sample collection date, and location. Outbreak samples from South Humboldt County include those from Hydesville, Fortuna, Loleta, and Eureka. Samples from North Humboldt County include those from Arcata, Trinidad, and Patrick's Point State Park. 1 No sequence data was obtained for the first 76 amino acids of the N gene. 2 Hydesville and Fortuna samples have S residue at this site. 3 Fx 32 has an E residue at this site. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0002555.t002",
