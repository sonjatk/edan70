    "text": "Since sexual transmission may occur with small amounts of virus, we investigated if pH-and antibody-dependent enhancement of transcytosis could occur at very low HIV-1 inocula. Using HIVIG or the anti-gp41 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2F5, we found that transcytosis occurred with virus inocula as low as 2 pg of p24 (about 60,000 RNA copies) with HIVIG and 0.02 pg of p24 (about 500 RNA copies) with 2F5, amounts too small to be detectable in subnatant fluid in the absence of low pH and HIV-1specific antibody ( Table 1) . These quantities of virus are within the range observed in seminal and cervicovaginal fluids of HIVinfected individuals [31, 32, 33] .",
