    "text": "Assessment of cytotoxic T cell responses of reservoir hosts has not been reported. Most assays that assess CTL functions require susceptible syngeneic target cells, which have been difficult to obtain with reservoir hosts. Susceptible primary cell lines from reservoir hosts have been produced [37, 78] , but these are typically obtained from embryonic fibroblasts, thus matching of MHC alleles for use in CTL assays is difficult.",
