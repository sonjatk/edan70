    "text": "Furthermore, the decisions with regard to the type of research, the study population and the research beneficiaries often lack transparency, are also dominated by the most powerful. The case of the swine flu, dubbed the Bpandemic that never really was^ (Evans 2010; Bonneux and Van Damme 2010) , demonstrates the potential consequences of private and uncommunicated decision-making processes in research and development. In the case of the swine flu, allegedly scientists conducting research and advising the World Health Organization on the virus were compensated by drug companies. This may have introduced bias (Evans, 2010, p. 296) . By increasing fear of a global pandemic, scientific research funded by pharmaceutical companies justified the stockpiling of antiviral supplies, thus increasing their vaccine sales (Evans 2010) .",
