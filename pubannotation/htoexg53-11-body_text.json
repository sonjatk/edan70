    "text": "To generate high titer vaccine preparations for preclinical studies, recombinant MVA was amplified in CEF, purified by ultracentrifugation through 36% sucrose cushions, resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, and stored at −80 • C. The sucrose purified MVA-MERS-N vaccine preparations corresponded in total protein/total DNA content to the purity profile of a MVA candidate vaccine for human use.",
