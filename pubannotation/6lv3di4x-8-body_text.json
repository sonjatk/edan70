    "text": "Although IFN-3 mRNA was upregulated in a few samples, neither of the JEV strains induced a statistically significant increase in expression for this gene at the investigated time points, suggesting an impact of JEV infection on the IFN pathway response (Fig.  4C ). It has been described that suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), a negative regulator of IFN responses, is upregulated in cells infected by JEV (36) . Interestingly, 48 to 72 hpi both JEV strains induced a significant upregulation of SOCS1 in NEC, with higher gene expression in Laos-infected cells (Fig. 4D) .",
