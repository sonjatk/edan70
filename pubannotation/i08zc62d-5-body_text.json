    "text": "Recently, we identified the natural geranylated flavonoids diplacone, mimulone, 3 0 -O-methyldiplacone and 4 0 -Omethyldiplacone from the fruit of Paulownia tomentosa (empress tree) and showed that they are potent inhibitors of both cholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase . Here, we report that geranylated flavonoids are novel inhibitors targeting bacterial sialidase. These compounds show striking competitive inhibitory effects against sialidase from C. perfringens (Cp-NanI). Importantly, C. perfringens is a human pathogen causing various gastrointestinal diseases such as enterotoxaemia, gas gangrene and peritonitis.",
