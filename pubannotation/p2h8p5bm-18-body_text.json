    "text": "In 1957 Isaacs and Lindenmann discovered IFN as a secreted factor that interfered with viral replication [98] . In the early pioneer work on IFN in the fifties and sixties, TBEV served as a model system, and TBEV was shown to induce IFN after infection and was also sensitive to pretreatment of IFNs [80, [99] [100] [101] [102] . Pretreatment of IFN was also found to inhibit KFDV, OHFV, and POWV titers in A549 cells (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial cells) [103] , thus IFN pretreatment induced broad spectrum inhibition of TBFVs. IFN has also been found to be strongly induced in the brains of POWV infected Peromyscus lecuopus, which are known as a natural host of the virus [104] . Similarly, IFN was found to be induced in sheep infected with LIV [105] , and IFN-stimulated genes were induced in brains of KFDV infected mice, indicating an activated IFN response [106] .",
