    "text": "The selection of the receptor destroyer NA for this study is motivated by its following properties. NA belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase family of proteins and catalyzes the cleavage of sialic acid residues from viral and cellular glycoproteins. Its most important function is to remove the terminal sialic acids from HA in order to enable the virus budding. Moreover, it helps the virus spreading through the system by additionally removing sialic acids from cell surfaces. In particular, since variations in the NA gene can lead to the evolution of more potent strains, studying the molecular evolution of this gene using the latest algorithms and computing power is essential.",
