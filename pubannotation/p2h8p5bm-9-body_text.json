    "text": "Although not much is known about POWV pathogenesis, recent studies in mice have found that tick saliva was important to enhance POWV transmission and the outcome of disease [50] . Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that POWV infects macrophages and fibroblasts in the skin, shortly after the tick bite, also, other unidentified cells were shown to be infected [51] . Interestingly, macrophages were found to be the primary target for POWV in the spleen [52] , and in the CNS, which is the main target site for POWV infection, neurons have been shown to be the primary target for POWV in mice and humans [52, 53] .",
