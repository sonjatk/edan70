    "text": "Titration of infectivity was carried out by a standard tissue culture infectious dose 50% (TCID 50 ) assay using MDCK cells. The presence of viral infection was determined at 72 h pi, by optical assessment of cytopathic effects coupled with a hemagglutination assay (HA). The titer was determined by the Reed and Muench method [24] . The limit of detection was of 20 TCID 50 /0.1 g of tissue.",
