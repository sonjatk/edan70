    "text": "To our knowledge, our study is the first in Europe to investigate paediatric influenza in PICU patients during the first three post-pandemic seasons after the 2009/10 pandemic. The strengths of our study include the multicentre design covering the majority of PICUs in Bavaria, the active screening for influenza in patients admitted to PICUs, and PCR-confirmation of all influenza cases. A limitation is that the corrected incidence estimates were based on the assumption that participating and nonparticipating PICUs treated a similar number of severe paediatric influenza patients. Although PICUs of both groups were of similar size, some of the non-participating PICUs, where paediatricians indicated lack of time as reason for non-participation, may have treated a higher number of patients, or patients with higher acuity. Further limitations include potential over-and underreporting in participating PICUs. On the one hand, due to different hospitalization rules some children may have been admitted to PICUs mainly for the purpose of monitoring their course of influenza disease more closely, thus resulting in an overestimate of severe cases. On the other hand, some parents of children with severe influenza may have refused study participation, or children with a fulminant course of influenza disease may have died before they were admitted to a PICU [4] . Thus, the high incidence estimates derived in this study may still underestimate the true burden of severe influenza. [19] b Key data from this study were pooled with data from Streng et al. 2011 [18] and compared using Fisher's Exact test or Mann-Whitney U-test, respectively",
