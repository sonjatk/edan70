    "text": "Hospitalized patients require more than a dozen daily medications that are administered at various hours and in multiple ways. Although physicians have the responsibilities to diagnose infections and prescribe medications for patients, nurses are responsible for actively caring, feeding, bathing, and dispensing medication for hospitalized patients throughout the day. Nurses are on the front line of fighting all kinds of diseases in the world, and they risk their lives to provide quality healthcare services in the hospital.",
