    "text": "Currently bat research within Western Asia is restricted and fragmented, primarily driven by a small number of dedicated individual researchers based at academic, government, and nongovernmental institutions. These researchers are leading efforts to discover new species and address knowledge gaps in topics such as bat diversity, distribution, taxonomy, and conservation [93, 98, 102, [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] . A few existing networks in the region are aligned with WAB-Net and will be included as part of this multinational One Health initiative. For example, the recently formed Bats of Eastern Europe, made up of bat experts from the Caucasus region, held their first international conference in October 2018 in Yerevan, Armenia [141] . Also, entities such as The Eastern Mediterranean Public Health Network (EMPHNET) based in Jordan and the Pak One Health Alliance of Pakistan are conducting critical work to improve public health outcomes and disease surveillance [142] [143] [144] . Despite the value and successes of these few established efforts, most research within the region remains either monodisciplinary, or limited in its geographic scope. The WAB-Net aims to fill a critical need to facilitate interaction: (1) among bat researchers scattered throughout Western Asia, and (2) between bat conservationists and those conducting viral disease surveillance within the region. Networking of existing bat researchers into a regional network, together with collaborative efforts to improve disease surveillance initiatives for humans and domestic animals, will help promote One Health solutions to regional threats [14, 145] .",
