    "text": "Others have observed that polyamines contribute to protease activity [39, 40] . Prior research in oat leaves identified polyamines as factors that reduce cellular protease activity and, as a result, leaf senescence [41] . The function of polyamines in plant tissues appears distinct from the functions in mammalian eukaryotic cells, though. For instance, spermidine interacts with and activates the activity of mammalian chymotrypsin [32, 33] . Whether polyamines function broadly in the function of proteases, especially viral proteases, has not been fully explored; however, our work suggests that viral proteases may be modulated by polyamines.",
