    "text": "The data are presented as the means ± standard deviation or as the median [interquartile range] for continuous variables and as numbers and percentages for categorical variables. The data were analyzed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests for normal distribution. The data were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test or Student's t-test for continuous variables and the χ 2 or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), and a two-sided P-value < 0.05 was considered to indicate significance.",
