    "text": "Viruses 2019, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 15 cloned a 2A target sequence-MTNTGAFG-and a 3C target sequence-AMEQG-into the firefly luciferase reporter [37] . We also cloned 2A and 3C into the pCMV plasmid to drive robust protease expression. These constructs were cotransfected into 293T cells either left untreated or treated with increasing doses of DFMO. Firefly activity was measured 24 h later and normalized to renilla activity. We observed that for both 2A ( Figure 4C ) and 3C ( Figure 4D ), protease activity was significantly reduced with DFMO treatment, to levels that were nearly undetectable with DFMO concentrations at or above 500 ÂµM. These data support our hypothesis that polyamines modulate viral protease activity, and polyamine depletion restricts virus replication by quelling viral protease activity. ",
