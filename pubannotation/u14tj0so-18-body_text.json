    "text": "If i.j and k.l are two base pairs of a secondary structure, R, and 1 ≤ i < k < j < l ≤ n, we say i.j crosses k.l. We refer to a secondary structure with crossing base pairs as a pseudoknotted secondary structure and a secondary structure with no crossing base pairs as a pseudoknot-free secondary structure (see Figure 1 ). Figure 1 shows different kinds of loops in a secondary structure. We refer the readers to Jabbari et al. [48] or Rastegari et al. [56] for precise definition and illustration of terms used in the figure. Figure 1 Pseudoknotted and pseudoknot-free secondary structures. Examples of loops and canonical base pairs in a pseudoknotted and a pseudoknot-free secondary structure. The blue base pairs belong to the G big structure and the green base pairs belong to the G small structure, as defined in Section 'Definition of G big and G small '. This figure was produced using the VARNA software [55] .",
