    "text": "The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and genotype (sequencing of the hexon gene after polymerase chain reaction [PCR] screening) of HAdVs among children with SARI in different areas of China from 2007 to 2010. HAdV infections are often associated with the co-infection of bacterial or viral agents [21] , frequently leading to severe clinical consequences in hospital patients. Thus, co-infection with other respiratory viruses of HAdV was also investigated.",
