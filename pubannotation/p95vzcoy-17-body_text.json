    "text": "All the samples from T1 (colonies fed for four weeks with DWV-infected honeybee pupae) and T2 (colonies fed for eight weeks with DWV-infected honeybee pupae) were strongly positive, with two exceptions (one pooled sample each during week 13 and 15). With 4.17/1 (T1) and 5.46/1 (T2), the ratio of DWV type-B to type-A was similar to the one in the feeding pupae (5.88/1 for DWV-B to DWV-A). Sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the identity of both DWV strains found in M. rubra (GenBank accession: DWV-A, JF346565.1, 99.73% identity, 100% query cover; DWV-B, AY251269.2, 98.84% identity, 99% query cover). The viral titers found in ants were in the range of 6.46-9.66 with a log mean of 7.95 ± 0.72 for T1, 6.17-10.18, 8.26 ± 1.02 for T2, and 3.17-5.88, 4.22 ± 0.85 in the control group seen over all weeks ( Figure 1 , Table 2 ). Viral titers in ants were significantly affected by the factors treatment (X 2",
