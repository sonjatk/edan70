    "text": "Triage acuity is defined by a 4-grade colour scale, white being the less urgent and red being the most. A white code means that the condition is not relevant or does not have an acute onset and is not affecting the vital signs; it can be reevaluated by the triage nurse if the symptoms modify and it might gain a higher priority. A green code indicates patients with normal vital signs but relevant, acute-onset symptoms; they should be reevaluated by the triage nurse every 30-60 minutes until medical evaluation. A yellow code is for those with severe lesions and altered vital signs that require rapid medical evaluation, so that these cases are closely communicated to the attending physician. A red code means that the condition is life-threatening (vital functions are compromised) and the patient requires immediate evaluation.",
