I remember we have several cases where two patients from one family will be admitted and their beds will be next to each other, it always happens that one will die and the other one will remain, it will be so touching some even ask if he/she will be fine, to avoid frustrating the patient we always request that he/she be transferred to another hospital.\" Nurse (N3) indicated that: \"Every time when I get to the wards I look at those kids some of them are very young and I just wish they would recover, they become so close to us like they are our own children or family members, we always encourage them to take medication and injections even when it is painful we help talk to them. Most of patients have side effects and they will vomit after taking medication and we always have to go all out and look for the food because they will be hungry.\"",
