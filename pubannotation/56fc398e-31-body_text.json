    "text": "As the transmission rate of the disease increases, epidemic sizes increase and a higher percentage of nodes are required for all sampling methods to make accurate predictions. For example when b ¼ 2, 25% of the nodes must be sampled using the TNS method and 50% for the SBS method to predict the overall epidemic size for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria, whereas for the RNS method almost all nodes must be sampled to capture epidemic behaviour (electronic supplementary material, figure S13). As the infectious period of the disease increases, a higher percentage of nodes needs to be sampled, but the effect of this is less pronounced than a variation in the transmission rate (electronic supplementary material, figures S14 and S15). For diseases with a very high transmission rate, a much higher percentage of nodes must be sampled for all methods, even when the infectious period is short (electronic supplementary material, figure S16). When we include within-market transmission into our model, we observe significantly larger epidemic sizes, with the mean epidemic size after one infectious period when b ¼ 1 and T ¼ 21 being 2266 farms for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria. The TNS and SBS methods under-predict epidemic sizes when less than 35% and 50% respectively of the nodes are sampled (electronic supplementary material, figure S7 ). In contrast to the scenario where markets do not amplify transmission, the RMS method predicts epidemic sizes accurately even when only a very small number (approx. 20%) of movements are sampled. This suggests that, if a significant level of transmission is thought to occur within markets, then either TNS or RMS would be the preferred strategies if only limited resources were available. Similar results are observed for outbreaks seeded in Devon and Aberdeenshire.",
