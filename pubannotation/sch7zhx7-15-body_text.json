    "text": "Polyamines were separated by thin-layer chromatography as previously described [30] . For all samples, cells were treated as described prior to being trypsinized and centrifuged. Pellets were washed with PBS and then resuspended in 200 µL 2% perchloric acid. Samples were then incubated overnight at 4 • C. 200 µL of supernatant was combined with 200 µL 5 mg/mL dansyl chloride (Sigma Aldrich) in acetone and 100 µL saturated sodium bicarbonate. Samples were incubated in the dark overnight at room temperature. Excess dansyl chloride was cleared by incubating the reaction with 100 µL 150 mg/mL proline (Sigma Aldrich). Dansylated polyamines were extracted with 50 µL toluene (Sigma Aldrich) and centrifuged. Five microliter of sample was added in small spots to the TLC plate (silica gel matrix; Sigma Aldrich) and exposed to ascending chromatography with 1:1 cyclohexane: ethyl acetate. The plate was dried and visualized via exposure to UV.",
