    "text": "Passaging CVB3 in Vero cells can result in the emergence of a virus with fitness changes that provide a replicative advantage, as we had observed with our CHIKV mutant viruses [31] . To determine whether our CVB3 mutants had fitness enhancement manifesting as a more rapidly replicating virus, we measured virus plaque sizes of wildtype and protease mutant virus. We observed no significant difference between wildtype and mutant CVB3 plaque size ( Figure 3D ). To better measure viral fitness via competition assay, we infected Vero cells with equal quantities of infectious virus of wildtype and 2A 29K or 3C 52R , and after five passages, we extracted RNA, reverse transcribed, amplified viral genomes by PCR, and Sanger sequenced the appropriate genomic locus corresponding to each protease (Table 1) . After the fifth passage, we observed that the wildtype and either protease mutant virus existed as a mixed population, with peaks corresponding to the wildtype and mutant nucleotide present in the samples ( Figure 3E , representative of three independent passages). Additionally, we passaged mutant virus without competition to determine the stability of the mutant. We observed that the mutation was maintained after five passages, suggesting that there is no fitness cost to this mutation in our cell culture conditions. Altogether, our data suggest that protease-mutant CVB3 exhibits no significant replicative advantage compared to wildtype CVB3. ",
