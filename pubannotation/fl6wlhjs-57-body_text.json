    "text": "The one-step prediction error process, {E k,t } is where we define c k,0 = 1 and c k,j = -b k,j for j = 1, ..., m. The process {E k,t } is a filtering of {X k,t } and so if {X k,t } is stationary, by the linear time invariant filtering result for stationary processes, {E k,t } is also stationary ( [18] , Theorem 4.10.1). Moreover for large enough m, if {X k,t } is an invertible time series process then we can approximate {X k,t } by an autoregressive, AR(m) process ( [18] , Theorem 4.4.3). Using this approximation we can argue that {E k,t } is approximately a mean zero Gaussian independent and identically distributed process with variance gamma Î³ X,k (0). Let {a 0 , ..., a L-1 } denote a pre-specified filter of width L. We define the detection process {D k,t } by filtering the error process {E k,t } using this filter. Thus, By the filtering result for stationary processes, stationarity of {X k,t } implies that {D k,t } is also a stationary process.",
