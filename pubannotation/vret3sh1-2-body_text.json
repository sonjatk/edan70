    "text": "The growth in the number of sequenced genomes has exceeded the most ambitious past estimations [1, 2] . Today, tens of thousands of genomes are being sequenced by public and private institutions around the globe [3, 4] , and whole-genome sequencing/re-sequencing has become a routine step of virtually any analysis of microbial behavior. In some fields, researchers are sequencing hundreds of genomes from distant taxa [5] to explore microbial diversity, while elsewhere, hundreds of closely related genomes are being sequenced to understand environmental adaptation, to support pangenome reconstruction [6, 7, 8] , and to build maps of microbial variomes [9] . Sequencing is also being applied to aid in solving urgent biological problems, including the development of strategies to combat emerging or reemerging biothreats, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus [10] , the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus [11, 12] , and the 2011 German Escherichia coli outbreak [13, 14] .",
