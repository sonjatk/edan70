    "text": "Recent data from our laboratory further supports an infectious disease etiology playing a role in KD. Numerous studies show that after an antigenic challenge, vaccination and natural infections, B cells transitioning to plasma cells, termed plasmablasts (PBs), can be seen in the peripheral blood [130, 131] . These can be recognized by surface markers of CD19, downregulation of CD20, and high levels of CD27 and CD38 [3, 132] . In comparison to the general circulating B cell population, PBs are enriched for B cells that contain infection-specific antibodies [133, 134] . This is variable as some studies show massive and high enrichment of PBs targeting the antigen of interest [135, 136] , while other studies show polyspecificity of the PB population and limited enrichment [137] [138] [139] [140] . Immunization studies in adults (tetanus [141] , influenza [132] , and rabies [142] ) show PB have more consistent enrichment for specific antibodies, temporally peak 5-10 days after immunization, and are predictive of later sero-immunity [143] . Elevated circulating peripheral PBs are not specific to infections, as they are elevated in a number of autoimmune diseases and their levels correlate to disease flares [144] . Although certain infections, such as dengue virus, may set off exceedingly high PB levels [145] , PB quantities tend to be significantly higher in autoimmune conditions than levels achieved during vaccination or post-infection. This excessive circulating PB response corresponds to flaring of the underlying inflammatory disease, and specifically correlates with c-reactive protein (CRP) level in studies on ulcerative colitis [145, 146] and IGG4 related disease [147, 148] .",
