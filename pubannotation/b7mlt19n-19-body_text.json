    "text": "Finally, we were able to identify proteins from Zika virus that have been just recently related to autophagy. Independent studies have shown that Zika virus activates autophagy and that the formation of autophagosomes is crucial to the replication of the virus. [79] [80] [81] It appears that the nonstructural proteins NS4A and NS4B are responsible for the induction of autophagy in infected cells by inhibiting the AKT-MTOR signaling, and both of them contain 3 WxxL motifs. 80, 82 Very little is known about the relation between Zika virus infection and autophagy modulation. We have found several proteins encoded by Zika genome polyprotein that contain LIR motifs, that could be good candidates for experimental validation.",
