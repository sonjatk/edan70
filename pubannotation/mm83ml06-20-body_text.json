    "text": "As treatment with P22077 or PR-619 led to reduced Gag processing, which should also reduce virus infectivity [61] , we next determined the impact of these DIs on the infectivity of released HIV-1 virus particles. To perform single round infections, we generated vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped pNLenv1 VLPs by transfecting HEK293T cells that were either incubated with the DIs P22077 or PR-619, or left untreated. VLPs were isolated and subsequently used for single round infections in TZM-bl cells, and infectivity was ascertained by measuring β-galactosidase activity. Treatment with 15 µM or 20 µM P22077 reduced the infectivity of released VLPs up to 2-fold, and 5-fold, respectively ( Figure 3) . Similarly, the infectivity of VLPs, generated under treatment with 7 µM or 14 µM PR-619, was about 4-or even 10-fold diminished. Thus, VLPs produced under DUB inhibition exhibit loss of specific infectivity, most likely due to impaired Gag processing. ",
