    "text": "In summary, we demonstrated that eEF1A interacts with NS5A and negatively modulates the CSFV growth. The possible mechanism of the negative effect of eEF1A on the CSFV growth is that eEF1A interacts with the CSFV IRES and inhibits its activity. Further studies are needed to define the detailed interplay among eEF1A, NS5A and IRES in the life cycle of CSFV.",
