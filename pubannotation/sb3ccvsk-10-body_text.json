    "text": "Foxp3 + Tregs infiltrate the CNS during acute JHMV infection and are retained together with both virus-specific and SR T cells during persistence (13, 19) . However, their role in regulating endogenously primed T cell populations of viral, and more importantly, SR specificity has not been addressed. To specifically investigate a function of Foxp3 + Tregs during JHMV persistence, we infected DEREG mice, in which DT treatment abrogated the vast majority of Foxp3 + Tregs under homeostatic conditions but retained a minor fraction thereby circumventing lymphoproliferative disease (22) . We first confirmed that transgene expression in DEREG mice does not alter JHMV pathogenesis compared to syngeneic WT mice. Clinical disease onset and progression, viral clearance, and CNS inflammatory responses were similar between the two groups (data not shown). The extent and severity of demyelination within spinal cords was also not altered (data not shown). Moreover, high fluorescent intensity of eGFP expressed under control of the Foxp3 promoter in DEREG mice enabled a distinct separation of the Foxp3 + population among CD4 + T cells compared to direct intracellular Foxp3-staining in WT mice ( Figure 1A) . Most importantly, no significant differences in the frequency of Foxp3 + cells within CD4 + T cells during JHMV infection were found comparing the two groups (data not shown). Validation of Foxp3 expression in DEREG mice thus facilitated characterization of Foxp3 + Treg kinetics during the course of infection. The frequency of Foxp3 + cells within CD4 + cells remained stable at ~15% within CLN at all time points (data not shown). By contrast, within both brain and spinal cord, Foxp3 + cells within CD4 + T cells peaked at day 7 p.i. and then rapidly decreased at day 10 p.i. (Figure 1B) . However, while the frequency of Foxp3 + Tregs was maintained at ~10% within the brain after day 10 p.i. (Figure 1B) , a sustained rebound was observed in spinal cords after day 14 p.i. during chronic infection ( Figure 1B) . The sustained increase in the fraction of Foxp3 + Tregs at later time points, specifically within the spinal cord, was not attributed to viral replication, as infectious virus is cleared by day 14 p.i., and viral RNA levels continuously decline after day 10 p.i. (15) . Onset of robust demyelination in spinal cords at day 14 p.i. (12) rather implicates that the second wave of Tregs is pathology-driven and functions to limit emerging SR CD4 + T cell responses.",
