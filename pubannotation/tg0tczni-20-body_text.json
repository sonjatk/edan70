    "text": "The frequencies of occurrence for dinucleotides were not randomly distributed and no dinucleotides were present at the expected frequencies. And the frequency of CpG and TpA was significantly low at all codon positions for coding region of 48 polioviruses genomes (mean ± S. D. = 0.490 ± 0.012; and mean ± S.D. = 0.748 ± 0.034. both < 0.78). The relative abundance of CpA and TpG also showed slight deviation from the ''normal range'' (mean ± S.D. = 1.253 ± 0.032 and 1.423 ± 0.023, respectively) ( Table 5 ). In addition, the RSCU values of the eight codons containing CpG (CCG, GCG, UCG, ACG, CGC, CGG, CGU, and CGA) were analyzed, to reveal the possible effects of CpG under-represented on codon usage bias. All of these eight codons were not preferential codons and were markedly suppressed. The six codons containing TpA (UUA, CUA, GUA, UAU, UAC and AUA) were suppressed too. Conversely, the RSCU values of the eight codons containing CpA (UCA, CCA, ACA, GCA, CAA, CAG, CAU, CAC) and five codons containing UpG (UUG, GUG, UGU, UGC, CUG) are high, and most of them (8 out of 13) were preferential codons ( Table 2 and Table 5 ). In addition, compared with DVPVs and live attenuated strain of polioviruses genotype 1, the wild viruses has higher frequencies of dinucleotides including CpG (Figure 2 and Table 5 ).",
