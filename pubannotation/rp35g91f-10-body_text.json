    "text": "The distribution of TNNI3 in BALB/c lung tissue was detected with a mouse monoclonal IgG 2a antibody (Abcam, clone 4C2). Briefly, sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and subjected to 20 min of heatinduced epitope retrieval (HIER) (pressure cooker) in Tris buffered saline (TBS)/EDTA buffer, pH 9.0 (Vector Laboratories). After 15 min cooling at room temperature, sections were washed in TBS (pH 7.4) and incubated in anti-TNNI3 primary antibody or mouse IgG isotype control (2 mg/ml in 3% fish skin gelatin in TBS) overnight at 4Â°. Sections were then washed in TBS for 1 hr before incubating in Mouse on Mouse Polymer (Abcam) for 30 min, washed in TBS, and incubated with diaminobenzidine (0.4 mg/ml, 3 min). Sections were counterstained with Mayers hematoxylin, blued with Scotts Tap Water Substitute, washed and dehydrated through graded alcohols to xylene, then coverslipped with Depex mounting medium. Cardiac a-actin (ACTC1) was detected with a mouse monoclonal IgG 1 antibody (Simga-Aldrich, clone Ac1-20.4.2), or mouse isotype control at 5 mg/ml, with the same protocol as above but with HIER in citrate buffer with pH 6.0 (Vector Laboratories). The presence of smooth muscle a-actin (ACTA2) was detected in a similar fashion, using mouse monoclonal IgG 2a antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, clone 1A4) at 9 mg/ml, and detection as above, but without HIER. Tissue was permeablized with 1% Triton X-100 for 15 min prior to the application of the primary antibody. Digital images were acquired on an Aperio ScanScope XT digital slide scanner (Leica Technologies). Images are typically of the left lobe and right middle lobe of four mice.",
