    "text": "Convalescent plasma therapy utilizes plasma or whole blood from people who have been infected with viral diseases and recovered. This therapy has been used during outbreaks when no particular medicines or vaccines are available for treatment [67] . The use of convalescent plasma has been indicated to be an efficient therapeutic strategy for diseases like MERS-CoV [68] . Studies have been carried out to confirm its feasibility and safety in treating MERS; however, the data are insufficient. There are a few drawbacks of this therapy, as often large-scale screening is required to obtain sufficient amount of antibodies from potential donors [69] .",
