    "text": "Although it seems speculative and complex, some researchers have found that reduction of the rate of poliovirus protein synthesis through large-scale utilization of codons that are not optimal has caused attenuation of viral virulence by lowering specific infectivity [34] . Therefore, the information from this study may not only have theoretical value in understanding poliovirus evolution (especially for DVPVs genotype 1), but also have practical value for the development the poliovirus vaccine. However, a more comprehensive analysis The range of coding region of 48 polioviruses's relative dinucleotide ratios. b Mean values of coding region of 48 polioviruses's relative dinucleotide ratios Â± S.D. Figure 2 Comparison the relative dinucleotide abundance in polioviruses DVPVs genotype 1, live attenuated virus genotype 1, wild viruses genotype 1, DVPVs genotype 2, DVPVs genotype 3 and live attenuated virus genotype 3.",
