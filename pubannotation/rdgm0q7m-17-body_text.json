    "text": "To explore the potential role of PCBPs in PRRSV PRF, we translated the pDluc/PRRSV mRNA in RRL reactions supplemented with nsp1␤, His-tagged human PCBP2, or both proteins ( Figure 3A ). We found that PCBP2 alone did not affect PRF (right hand lane), but when added together with nsp1␤, synthesis of the −1 PRF product was stimulated some 3-fold (see Supplementary Table) . We reasoned that if the 'active' trans-acting stimulator of PRF in PRRSV is a complex of nsp1␤ and PCBP, the RRL system may already contain an abundant form of PCBP, but one which would, in complex with nsp1␤, preferentially induce −2 PRF. In this experiment, supplementation with PCBP2 may have generated nsp1␤-PCBP2 complexes that could preferentially promote −1 PRF. We therefore translated the PRRSV frameshift reporter mRNA in the WG in vitro translation system on the basis that this lysate might contain fewer endogenous PCBPs, or PCBPs of sufficient evolutionary divergence to preclude any interactions with nsp1␤. Consistent with our hypothesis, PRF at the PRRSV signal in WG was found to be completely dependent upon the addition of both nsp1␤ and PCBP2, with neither protein alone having any frameshift-stimulatory activity in this system ( Figure 3B ). Further, supplementation of WG translations with PCBP2 led preferentially to a −1 PRF, whereas with human PCPB1, −2 PRF was most evident (Figure 3C) , suggesting that the abundant form in RRL is PCBP1. We also tested mouse PCBP3, human PCBP4 and mouse hn-RNP K/J in WG translations ( Figure 3C and D) . Of these three proteins, only PCBP3 was able to promote frameshifting, with both −2 and −1 PRF products observed at similar levels ( Figure 3C ). We confirmed the involvement of PCBP1 and 2 in frameshifting in cultured cells using siRNAs (Supplementary Figure S2 ). Knockdown of PCBPs individually or together substantially reduced PRF, with PCBP1 noticeably affecting −2 PRF, and PCBP2, −1 PRF, consistent with the results of the WG assays above. No effect on PRF was seen with siRNAs targeting PCBP3, PCBP4 or hnRNP K/J, although we could not verify knockdown of PCBP3 due to lack of a reactive antibody.",
