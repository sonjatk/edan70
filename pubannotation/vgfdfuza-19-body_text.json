    "text": "Inadequate infrastructure to facilitate optimal infection prevention and control measures was the most commonly cited challenge in addressing AMR. Though infection prevention and control efforts were highly regulated in both the public and private hospital settings, certain contextual factors such as lack of sufficient single room facility were highly challenging to overcome. A few participants mentioned that the design of hospital wards with one room having six beds or eight beds was not conducive to prevent infections: \"It's not really our fault. You are sitting here scolding us, that we have a lot of MRSA but it's because, it's not poor infection control. You are making us take care of patients in overcrowded hospitals. You know, it's very different from the US or Europe where most of their rooms are two-bedders. If you have a six-bedder, even if I wash my hands, the uncle there who has a maid, and the maid is talking to the other maid and they all share, you know . . . and it's practically, it's all crowded, all these infrastructure issues.\" -I04, Human Health",
