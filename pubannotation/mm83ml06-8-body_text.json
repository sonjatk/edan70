    "text": "HeLa cells were transiently transfected with p∆R PR - [32] . After overnight cultivation at 37 • C, released VLPs were harvested as described above and lysed in protease cleavage buffer (50 mM MES pH 6.5, 1 M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 adapted from [55] ). In vitro processing was performed using 2.56 µM Recombinant HIV1 Protease Protein (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 9 h at 37 • C. Processing was terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiling.",
