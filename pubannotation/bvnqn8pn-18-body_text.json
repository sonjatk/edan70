    "text": "One hundred ninety-one patients (31%) had a previous history of asthma or wheezing bronchitis and 54 of them (28%) were using an asthma controller therapy. Most had a mild exacerbation ( = 110; 57%) and 69 (36%) moderate, while only 12 (6%) presented a severe asthma attack. Sixteen percent of them required admission either to the short-stay observation or to the Pediatric Ward. Among the children with a previous asthma diagnosis, 95 (49%) were ≥6 years and 63 of them (67%) were not using any controller therapy (either for no prescription or for no use). The severity of the exacerbations in patients who are ≥6 years with a previous diagnosis of asthma and divided into two subgroups (controller therapy, no controller therapy) is shown in Figure 3 : asthmatic patients not using a controller medication were more likely to have a moderate-to-severe exacerbation than their peers under long-term therapy ( < .01).",
