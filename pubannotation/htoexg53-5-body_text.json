    "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a hitherto unknown Î²-coronavirus, emerged as a causative agent of a severe respiratory disease in humans in 2012. This new coronavirus was first isolated from the sputum of a patient suffering from severe pneumonia and renal failure [1] . To date, the MERS-CoV still causes disease and death in humans with a total of 2260 confirmed cases including 803 fatalities [2, 3] . Epidemiological data suggest that the MERS-CoV is endemic in Saudi Arabia, which accounts for the majority of primary community-acquired cases. Many of those primary cases are due to virus exposure through direct contact with dromedary camels, the primary animal reservoir of MERS-CoV. Alternatively, camel workers undergoing subclinical infections are suggested to mediate virus transmission to other susceptible individuals [4, 5] . Other outbreaks of MERS have been caused by nosocomial transmissions in health care settings [6] [7] [8] [9] . Most of the MERS-CoV infections occur within the Arabian Peninsula, i.e., Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates, however MERS cases have been reported in various other countries around the world [9, 10] .",
