    "text": "To reconstruct the dynamics of PARP14 and 15 gain and loss, publically available vertebrate genome assemblies and gene prediction datasets were queried for PARP genes using a combination of blast searches [65] , pairwise comparisons of genomic sequences using dotter [66] and the sim4cc program [67] that aligns reference cDNA sequences to genomic sequences from other species. We eliminated from further analysis any PARP sequences that contained frameshifts or nonsense mutations, but retained some genes that were missing up to three exons within genome assembly gaps. Protein sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW [68] with manual adjustment and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees (1000 bootstrap replicates) were constructed using PhyML [69] using the best-fitting evolutionary model (JTT+I+G+F) as determined by Prottest [70] . Trees were displayed using MEGA [71] .",
