    "text": "Perhaps the most universal finding of this systematic review is the role of social and economic inequality, including poverty during an epidemic. Regardless of the national income setting, minority and marginalized communities are the most devastated by an epidemic. If organizations and governments are to adequately respond to these individuals and communities, it is critical that narratives of those most vulnerable to an epidemic-specifically poor communities-are represented in the mainstream media as well as in the peer reviewed published literature-especially, the epidemiological and medical literature that tends to influence health programming and policy-making.",
