    "text": "Following this, the peptides within the V8 and H8 peptide pools were used to elucidate in more detail the T cell epitope specificities. We subdivided the peptides from H8 and V8 in four new pools each containing five peptides (H8.1, H8.2, V8.1, V8.2 ). In addition, we separately tested the two 15-mer peptides #89 and #90, which were shared between pools H8 and V8. We again vaccinated BALB/c mice with MVA-MERS-N using i.p. or i.m. inoculations in a prime-boost regime. Splenocytes were prepared at day eight after the last vaccination and purified CD8+ T cells were restimulated with subpools V8.1., V8.2., H8.1, and H8.2 (Figure 4a ). Stimulation with peptides from pools V8.1 or H8.1 activated only minor levels of IFN-γ producing cells with mean levels about 23 SFC/10 6 splenocytes. Yet, the stimulation with subpools V8.2 and H8.2 revealed clearly higher numbers of activated T cells with 83-176 IFN-γ SFC/10 6 splenocytes. Comparable numbers of IFN-γ producing cells were again induced by i.p. or i.m. immunization. Of note, the stimulations with the 15-mer peptides #89 (N 353-367 = QNIDAYKTFPKKEKK) or #90 (N 357-371 = AYKTFPKKEKKQKAP) alone resulted in detection of substantial quantities of IFN-γ producing cells (mean levels about 71-107 SFC/10 6 splenocytes) in mice that had been vaccinated with MVA-MERS-N by both immunization routes (Figure 4b ). CD8+ T cells purified from mice receiving non-recombinant MVA or mock vaccine (PBS) did not produce IFN-γ following stimulation with peptides from subpools V8.1-H8.2 and with peptides #89 and #90. When checking for the specific peptides contained within the subpools, we observed that the strongly stimulatory peptides #89 and #90 were part of the subpools V8.2 and H8.2, whereas these peptides were absent in V8.1 and H8.1. This data suggested that the overlapping 15-mer peptides #89 and #90 contained a valuable antigen epitope for the activation of MERS-CoV N-specific CD8+ T cell responses. ",
