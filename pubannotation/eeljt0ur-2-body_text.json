    "text": "Management of feline chronic gastroenteropathies has included intervention with both veterinary therapeutic formulas designed to manage non-specific gastrointestinal disorders and those designed with limited novel or hydrolyzed ingredients for management of food-responsive enteropathies and steroid-responsive enteropathies (inflammatory bowel disease). There have been few studies evaluating the use of dietary intervention for the management of feline chronic gastroenteropathy. This prospective, multi-center study evaluated the use of two commercially available feline veterinary therapeutic dry diets designed to manage non-specific gastrointestinal disorders in 28 cats with a history of chronic vomiting and/or diarrhea. The majority of cats enrolled in the study had a history of vomiting (n = 25), with a smaller number having a history of concurrent diarrhea (n = 2) or diarrhea alone (n = 3). Cats were excluded if diagnostic tests identified any systemic or infectious disease that could be associated with the clinical signs of vomiting or diarrhea, and if they were panhypoproteinemic, hypoalbuminemic, hypocobalaminemic, or had a Spec fPL ≥5.4 µg/L. Cats were randomized to one of two veterinary therapeutic diets for 4 weeks. Feeding of both therapeutic diets resulted in a numeric reduction in the number of vomiting episodes over the 4-week period, but no significant differences were seen between dietary interventions. When looking within dietary groups, significant differences were seen in cats fed Diet A with reductions of 69.1, 73.3, and 63.2% (p values of 0.008, 0.003, and 0.029) in weeks 2, 3, and 4, respectively, when compared to week 0. The probability of vomiting also showed significant reductions in cats fed Diet A between weeks 0 and 2, 3, and 4, with odds ratios of 0.008, 0.005, and 0.005, respectively (p values of 0.038, 0.23, and 0.23). Results of this study demonstrate that a veterinary therapeutic gastrointestinal formula can be effective in the management of feline chronic vomiting. Cats that fail to respond to this dietary approach after a 2-to 4-week trial may benefit from a limited novel or hydrolyzed ingredient formula and may require additional diagnostics to better characterize the underlying disease. Keywords inTrODUcTiOn Dietary recommendation for the management of chronic gastroenteropathy in cats has included the use of both veterinary therapeutic elimination and veterinary therapeutic gastrointestinal formulas (1) (2) (3) . Veterinary elimination diets are designed to limit dietary antigens by incorporating uncommon or hydrolyzed protein ingredients and are utilized to diagnose and manage gastrointestinal and/or dermatologic conditions with an underlying food intolerance or food allergy. Veterinary gastrointestinal formulas differ in that they do not necessarily utilize unique or hydrolyzed protein sources but are designed with highly digestible ingredients to facilitate digestion and absorption of nutrients within a compromised gastrointestinal tract. Veterinary gastrointestinal formulas may also incorporate other dietary modifications such as adjustment of macronutrient distribution, fatty acid composition, and inclusion of dietary fibers and prebiotics. While nutritional intervention is commonly utilized to manage chronic gastroenteropathy in cats, there have only been a handful of reported studies evaluating the efficacy of nutritional intervention in naturally occurring disease (4-7). Guilford et al. showed that 49% of 55 cats with chronic gastrointestinal disease were responsive to dietary change, and 29% of the 55 demonstrated a food allergy or sensitivity with recrudescence of clinical signs upon diet re-challenge (4). In another study, eight cats with chronic diarrhea and/or vomiting responded to dietary therapy with a hydrolyzed diet after other medical and dietary interventions were unsuccessful (5) . Laflamme et al. demonstrated improvement in fecal score in 78.2% of 55 cats with chronic diarrhea fed either a low-fat (23% ME) or high-fat (45.1% ME) dry diet containing common ingredients (6) . Additionally, two canned therapeutic gastrointestinal formulas containing common ingredients were evaluated for the management of naturally occurring chronic diarrhea, demonstrating resolution to a normal fecal score in up to 46.7% of 15 cats (7).",
