    "text": "In experimentally-infected deer mice, SNV nucleocapsid-specific antibodies can be detected in serum as early as 10 days post infection, and neutralizing antibody can be detected after three weeks post infection [13] . Similarly, experimentally-infected bank voles produce PUUV-specific antibodies two to three weeks after inoculation [14] and rats experimentally infected with SEOV also produce IgG within two weeks post inoculation [52] . The presence of IgG in these naturally and experimentally infected reservoirs is an indicator of class switching and affinity maturation, events that are mediated by T cells [53] . Thus, rodents mount adaptive T cell/B cell immune responses to their reservoir hantaviruses; however, it appears to be inadequate for virus clearance. While inflammatory signatures are present [13, 20, 54] , the magnitude of these signals appears to be modest relative to expression levels found in a Syrian hamster pathology model of HCPS [55] . It is noteworthy that immunization of rodent reservoirs with homologous nucleocapsid antigen or plasmids encoding the antigen protects from subsequent challenge [56, 57] , suggesting infection can be prevented in reservoir hosts.",
