    "text": "To directly assess whether elevated T cell activation is antigen driven or more polyclonal in nature, we measured the frequencies of both virus-specific as well as SR CD4 + T cells in CLN following Foxp3 + Treg depletion. Frequencies of virus-specific CD4 + T cells, as analyzed by IFN-γ secreting cells following viral peptide M 133 stimulation, were not altered in DTR + compared to DTR − mice (Figure 3) . However, reflecting overall increased cellularity, their absolute numbers increased more than threefold (Figure 3) . We next assessed how Foxp3 + Tregs regulate SR-specific CD4 + T cells in CLN. Similar to virus-specific CD4 + T cells, myelin-specific endogenous CD4 + T cells are activated in CLN, albeit at later times correlating with demyelination (13) . More importantly, APC presenting myelin Ag are present in CLN of chronically infected mice (13) . Analysis of SR IFN-γ-secreting MOG 35−55 and MBP 60−80 specific CD4 + T cell frequencies revealed a threefold increase following Foxp3 + Treg depletion compared to the very low frequencies in DT-treated DTR − mice (~30 cells per 10 6 CLN cells; Figure 3 ). Higher frequencies of SR T cells thus correlated with an overall ninefold increase of MOG 35−55 and MBP 60−80 specific CD4 + T cell numbers within the CLN of DTR + mice compared to controls (Figure 3) . These data indicated that Foxp3 + Tregs unspecifically regulate overall CLN cellularity and T cell activation during JHMV persistence but specifically limit expansion of SR CD4 T cells emerging after onset of demyelination. (20) . Surprisingly however, Foxp3 + Treg depletion altered neither total CNS cellular infiltration ( Figure 4A ) nor frequencies of inflammatory leukocytes ( Figure 4B ) at d28 p.i. Percentages of CD11b + , CD4 + , and CD8 + T cells, including virus-specific CD8 + , all remained similar irrespective of Foxp3 + Treg depletion (Figures 4C,D) . T cell activation in the CNS cannot readily be deduced by their phenotype as the majority of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells express a CD44 + CD62L low CD69 + effector phenotype throughout infection (27) . Nevertheless, as anticipated, we found no phenotypic T cell differences in DT-treated DTR − compared to DTR + mice (data not shown). Similar overall T cell effector function was supported by identical levels of mRNA encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL-2 in both brain and spinal cord ( Figure 4E) . No apparent differences in T cell numbers or function were also reflected in identical levels of persisting viral mRNA in both brains and spinal cords ( Figure 4F) . These data indicated that viral persistence was not regulated by Foxp3 + Tregs, distinct from CLN. Finally, no overt differences in demyelination in Foxp3 + Treg ablated mice indicated a minor, if any, role of this Treg subset in CNS tissue damage ( Figure 4G) . These data demonstrated that Foxp3 + Tregs control T cell activation and inflammatory responses within CLN but have no effect on CNS inflammation and pathology during chronic JHMV infection.",
