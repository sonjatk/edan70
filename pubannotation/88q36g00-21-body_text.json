    "text": "Y-maze test. The Y-maze test was carried out as described previously 80 . Briefly, the test was performed in a Y-shaped maze with three opaque plastic arms situated at 120Â° angles from each other. Each mouse was placed individually in the center of the apparatus and allowed to explore the maze freely during an 8-min session. The series of arm entries were recorded visually. Alternation was defined as successive entries into the three arms, on overlapping triplet sets. The percent alternation was calculated as the ratio of actual to possible alternations (defined as the total number of arm entries minus two) multiplied by 100. Spontaneous alternation (%) was used to quantify short-term memory.",
