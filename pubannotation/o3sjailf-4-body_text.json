    "text": "Astrovirus VA1 belongs to the novel Mamastrovirus 9 species (Astroviridae family) and was first identified in 2009 in human stools during an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis. [6] [7] [8] Its prevalence in stools ranges from 0.2% to 1.6% in diarrheic and non-diarrheic subjects worldwide. [8] [9] [10] Furthermore, astrovirus VA1 has been identified in brain biopsies of immunocompromised patients with central nervous system disease, 9, [11] [12] [13] but it has never been documented in respiratory specimens until now. Current molecular diagnostic assays used in most routine laboratories target only the classical HAstV 1-8 serotypes, which belong to the Mamastrovirus 1 species; yet, astrovirus VA1 cannot be diagnosed because it shares only a 46% nucleotide sequence identity with the full genome of HAstV-1. This is particularly unfortunate, as a recent investigation of healthy adult blood donors in the United States showed that 65% of the samples were seropositive. 14 In terms of public health relevance, there is increasing evidence that astrovirus VA1 and other novel HAstVs recently described worldwide (i.e., astrovirus VA1-5 and MLB1-3 15 ) may be of importance in routine diagnostics, particularly in immunocompromised patients. To our knowledge, our finding is the first documented case of an astrovirus VA1 in the respiratory tract, and it justifies considering the potential association of recently identified new human astroviruses, such as astrovirus VA1, with ",
