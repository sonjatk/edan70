    "text": "The homeostasis of eukaryotic cells is maintained by a well-tuned balance between biosynthesis and degradation of proteins. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) constitutes the main non-lysosomal intracellular protein degradation pathway that comprises three major components: the proteasome holoenzymes, a number of ubiquitin ligases and a broad variety of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). Ubiquitin (Ub) is attached to target proteins by the cascade-like catalytic action of E1, E2 and E3 enzymes. The ubiquitin molecule is activated by an E1 ligase, followed by the transfer to one of numerous conjugating enzymes, and finally an E3 ligase catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin onto the Îµ-amino group of a Lysine residue within the target protein (for review see [1] ). Thereby, the",
