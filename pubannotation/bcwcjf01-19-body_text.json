    "text": "Phylogenetic analysis grouped samples according to date and geography ( Figure 3 ). The sequence data obtained from samples collected between 1995-1996 differed from the 2003-10 samples by four amino acid changes in the G protein; L12Q, D427G, P485L, and S501P, and each involved a change in polarity ( Table 2 ). One amino acid change, G428S, characterized samples obtained from the southern region versus from the northern region. Samples from Arcata were also defined by nucleotide changes and samples from the southern region of Humboldt Co., Loleta, Fortuna, and Hydesville, grouped together as did most of the Eureka samples ( Figure 3 , Figure S5 ). The exceptions were Fx44 from mid Eureka and Fx34 from just east of Eureka, which consistently grouped with the Arcata samples (Figures 1 and 2) . Figure S6 ). Skunk 2 from 1995 differed from all other samples at site 69 where a Y was present rather than an H ( Table 2) .",
