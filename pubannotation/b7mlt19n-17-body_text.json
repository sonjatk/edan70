    "text": "Our literature searching strategy pinpointed several nonstructural viral proteins; one of those was the protein NS1 from Dengue viruses. Studies have shown that NS1 protein from Dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) colocalizes with LC3 and that DENV-2 particles and autophagosomes travel together during viral infection. 58, 74 In contrast to DENV-2, NS1 protein from DENV-3 displays a low level of colocalization with LC3. 75 Sequence alignment of NS1 proteins from DENV-2 and DENV-3 showed that they are highly conserved. However, checking for the presence of LIR motifs revealed a discrepancy between them. We observed that DENV-2 NS1 has an xLIR motif (ASFIEV) that is not recognized in any DENV-3 NS1 sequences due to the substitution F to L, as well as an additional WxxL motif with a PSSM score 12 (RAWNSL) that is absent in DENV-3 (SL to VW) (Fig. S1 ). It is possible that the absence of either the xLIR or WxxL motifs (or both) in DENV-3 is responsible for its lower affinity to LC3.",
