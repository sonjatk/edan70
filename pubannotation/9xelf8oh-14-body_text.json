    "text": "Optimised assays were tested for pathogen specificity by seeding six qPCR reactions with DNA extracted from tissue infected with monkeypox virus (two tissue samples) and cowpox virus (two tissue samples) and individual cell culture isolates that contained canine adenovirus 1 and 2. The results of the new assays were compared with the SQPV PCR assay (Atkin et al. 2010 ) and TEM methods used to identify SADV (Everest et al. 2008 ). In the absence of a gold standard for both target pathogens, a test of agreement (Pfeiffer 2010) was performed to compare whether the assays similarly reported presence or absence of virus. When comparing qPCR assays, the quantitative values were investigated for correlation using a Pearson's correlation. All statistical analyses (including generating figures) were performed using R v.2.15.1 (R Core Team 2012). Where quoted, all confidence intervals (CI) are at the 95 % level.",
