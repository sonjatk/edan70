    "text": "Effective wildlife disease surveillance is important, with links between wildlife and pathogens relevant to human and domestic animal health being commonly discovered, e.g. Echinococcus multilocularis (Hegglin et al. 2015) , SARS coronavirus (Bell and Roberton 2004) , avian influenza (Fouchier et al. 2004) , hantavirus (Watson et al. 2014) and Ebola (Leroy et al. 2005) . Wildlife disease surveillance thus forms an essential part of the 'One Health' theme (Thompson 2013) , with studies providing an opportunity to both benefit human health and the wildlife species in question (Jenkins et al. 2015) . To minimise transmission of pathogens between wildlife and livestock or humans, it is necessary to understand the species' ecology and pathogen transmission pathways (Boadella et al. 2011; Delahay et al. 2009 ). Any investigation of host-pathogen dynamics relies on a sensitive and specific detection assay (Boadella et al. 2011) , and yet application of current molecular techniques to wildlife disease epidemiology has been slow in comparison with studies of humans and livestock (Benton et al. 2015) .",
