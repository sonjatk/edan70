    "text": "Continuous variables were described as median and interquartile range (IQR), categorical variables as number and percentage. Pneumonia cases we compared to the controls by the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous covariates, and by the Chi 2 test for categorical variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with pneumonia. Multivariate analyses were adjusted for gender, age, period per quarter, and other pathogens significantly associated with increased risk of pneumonia. Concordance between serotypes detected in nasopharyngeal samples and blood was tested by Kendall rank correlation.",
