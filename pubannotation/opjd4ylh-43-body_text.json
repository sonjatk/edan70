    "text": "According to the findings of this study, there is a shortage of equipment and working resources were impacting the quality of health in the TB wards. Participants appeared to be scared and were discouraged by the poor supply of resources in the wards. There was poor supply of N95 respiratory masks, UV lights were not regularly serviced, and there were no fans and air conditioners in the wards. The wards had small windows. There was also poor hygiene practice since there was a poor supply of detergents and hand washing soap. A study done by Mosadeghrad [19] concludes that inadequate or non-available facilities, equipment, and resources, especially basic resources to provide services such as water, steam, and electricity, hindered the provision of quality healthcare, proper conduct of tests, therapies, investigations, and surgery. Another study done by Reilly [20] , concluded that patients are almost twice as likely to die in some hospitals because they lack the proper equipment and resources.",
