    "text": "Propidium iodide (PI) staining was used to measure the nuclear DNA content according to previous study (Yu et al., 2015) . Firstly, the cells were collected and fixed with 1 ml of cold 70% ethanol at 4 • C overnight and then re-suspended in PI staining buffer (50 µg/ml PI (Sigma), 20 µg/ml RNase in PBS) for 2 h at 4 • C. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACScan; BD) were used to analyze the PI-stained cells, and at least 10,000 cells were counted for each sample. ModFit LT, version 2.0 (Verity Software House) was performed for data analysis.",
