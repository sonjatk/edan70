    "text": "Recent outbreaks of CoVs in humans and domestic animals elevates the viral family Coronaviridae to be of great concern as a likely source of new emerging infectious diseases, and a priority for future viral surveillance efforts. Based on our current understanding of CoV systematics, all human CoVs have evolutionary origins in wildlife reservoirs, with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and human-CoVs NL63 and 229E considered to have originated in bats [39, 124, 125] . Moreover, spillover of bat-associated CoVs has occurred into domestic animals, for example SADS-CoV has a 90% mortality rate in young piglets [33, 124] . On a global scale, reported CoV diversity mirrored species richness, suggesting regions with greater species richness will also have higher CoV diversity [9] . We found that research effort on bat-associated CoVs was significantly correlated with species richness across the 247 countries included in our analysis (r = 0.26, p = 0.001) (Table S3 ). However, research effort was greatly skewed towards the United States and China ( Figure 6) , with 71% of all other countries reporting no published research on bat-associated CoVs (Table S4) . Not surprising, China published the most studies on bat-associated CoVs, which is largely driven by targeted efforts to Figure 5 . Research effort on bat-associated viruses by country. The research effort was quantified as the number of publications indexed in PubMed that included the search terms (\"bat\" OR \"bats\" OR \"Chiroptera\") AND (\"virus\" OR \"viruses\") by country. Raw data provided in Table S4 .",
