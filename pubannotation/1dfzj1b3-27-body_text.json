    "text": "The antioxidant activity of Hymenocrater longiflorus Benth. from Iran was evaluated [47] . The main components of the oils included α-pinene, 1,8-cineole, β-eudesmol, spathulenol, hedycaryol, δ-cadinene, among other components, nevertheless predominating the oxygenated sesquiterpenids (47.4%). The essential oils were able to inhibit the bleaching of β-carotene. The precentage of inhibition was even close (66.4%) to those found for the non-polar-sub-fraction (chloroformic) (69.1%), which presented the best activity. However, the authors did not explain these results which are contradictory to those obtained when the antioxidant activity was measured through other method, in which the polar fraction rich in phenolic compouds had the greatest activity [47] .",
