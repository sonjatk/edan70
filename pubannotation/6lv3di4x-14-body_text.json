    "text": "Epithelial cells from the respiratory tract release innate cytokines in response to a viral infection, also known as \"alarmins,\" which include IL-33, IL-25, and thymic stromal lyphoprotein (TSLP); these cytokines activate immune cells like T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages, normally driving a Th2 immune response (42) (43) (44) (45) . We therefore investigated the impact of these alarmins which could be potentially released by JEV-infected epithelial cells. To this end, we tested the effects of human recombinant IL-25, IL-33, and TSLP on macrophage infectivity by JEV. These experiments showed Data are shown as 25% to 75% interquartile boxes with means and 95% confidence intervals. Different superscript letters indicate significant difference (P Ͻ 0.05) between samples challenged with the same JEV strain (letters without and with apostrophe for JEV Laos and JEV Nakayama, respectively); differences between distinct JEV strains and the mock control at the same time postinfection are shown by asterisks (*, P Յ 0.05; **, P Յ 0.002).",
