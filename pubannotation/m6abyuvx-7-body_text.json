    "text": "Histological analysis showed HCV core protein expression in most hepatocytes of the transgenic mice; these mice showed evidence of lymphocytic infiltration that was caused by the HCV core proteins ( Figure 1D and E). These observations, in addition to the modified histology activity index (HAI) scores, indicated that expression of HCV proteins caused chronic hepatitis in the CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice because a weak, though persistent, immune response followed an initial bout of acute hepatitis ( Figure  S1 ). Moreover, we observed a number of other pathological changes in these mice -including swelling of hepatocytes, abnormal architecture of liver-cell cords, abnormal accumulation of glycogen, steatosis, fibrosis, and HCC (Figures 1E and F, Table  S1 ). Steatosis was mild in the younger mice (day 21) and became increasingly severe over time (days 120 and 180; Figure S2 ). Importantly, none of the pathological changes were observed in the CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (2/2) mice after poly(I:C) injection ( Figure 1F ).",
