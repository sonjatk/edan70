    "text": "The cDNA encoding the entire amino acid (aa) sequence (413 aa) of the MERS-CoV N protein was in silico modified by introducing silent codon alterations to remove three termination signals (TTTTTNT) for vaccinia virus early transcription and two G/C nucleotide runs from the original MERS-CoV gene sequence (Human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012, GenBank accession no. JX869059). A cDNA fragment was generated by DNA synthesis (Invitrogen Life Technology, Regensburg, Germany) and cloned into the MVA transfer plasmid pIIIH5red [45] to place the MERS-CoV N gene sequence under the transcriptional control of the vaccinia virus early/late promoter PmH5 [46] resulting in the MVA vector plasmid pIIIH5red-MERS-N.",
