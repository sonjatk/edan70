    "text": "In pigs, PWD can be controlled using various preventive strategies without using antimicrobials (Table 3) . Feed supplements such as zinc oxide, organic acids, pre-probiotics, synbiotics, dehydrated porcine plasma, antimicrobial peptides, specific egg yolk and bacteriophages [31, 89, [106] [107] [108] [109] [110] have been used in weanling pigs to enhance growth, feed efficiency and to reduce PWD.
