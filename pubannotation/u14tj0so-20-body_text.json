    "text": "We use three data sets to analyze performance of our algorithms. Our first data set is the test data set of Andronescu et al. [36] , that contains 446 distinct RNA sequences and their reference structures, of which 348 are pseudoknotfree and 98 are pseudoknotted. This set has four structures that are not in the class of structures our methods can handle (i.e., have densities higher than 2 [48] ). Since the number of such structures is too small to be useful in an experimental analysis, we removed them from our set of pseudoknotted structures, resulting in a set of size 442.",
