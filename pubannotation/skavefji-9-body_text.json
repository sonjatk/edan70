    "text": "Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with BAL was performed following a standardized protocol as previously described [14] . Briefly, BAL was performed by instillation of three consecutive aliquots of sterile saline solution (20-30-30 ml) into the bronchial tree at the area that was most abnormal on the chest radiography. The right middle lobe or lingual segment was chosen in patients with bilateral diffuse infiltration. BAL fluid that was first retrieved was discarded, and BAL fluid that was subsequently retrieved was collected. The total cell count was determined using a hemocytometer. The corresponding amount of BAL fluid for 10 3 cells was centrifuged onto a microscope slide using a Thermo Shandon Cytospin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), at 500 rpm for 5 minutes at room temperature. The slide was airdried and stained with Wright-Giemsa stain. Differential cell counts that included percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes, alveolar macrophages, and eosinophils were determined.",
