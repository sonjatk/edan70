    "text": "Recently, putative nonstructural NSs sequences have been identified in some hantaviruses [3, 67] . This sequence is in an alternative reading frame of the nucleocapsid transcript. In other bunyaviruses, NSs has anti-interferon activity [68] [69] [70] ; however, its role in hantavirus infections is less well characterized.",
