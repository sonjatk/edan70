    "text": "Note that the limit, lim t → ∞ F(t) = AR. Based on a statistical analysis of an anthrax outbreak that occurred in Sverdlovsk, Russia, Brookmeyer, et al. [17] estimate hazard rates of between 0.05 and 0.11 for θ (which is compatible with θ = 0.07 obtained from animal studies for an AR of 0.5). The value of λ is not estimated in their data analysis -based on animal studies they found that the rate λ lies between 5 × 10 -7 and 10 -5 . Buckeridge, et al. [16] propose log normal models for the duration of the prodromal and fulminant stages, based on the 2001 anthrax attack in the United States. The median duration of the prodromal stage was 12.18 days, with a dispersion of 1.41, and the median duration of the fulminant stage was 1.5 days with a dispersion again of 1.41.",
