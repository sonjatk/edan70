    "text": "The fluorescent reporter dyes were FAM (endogenous control), Texas Red (SQPV) and Cy5 (SADV), with quenchers BHQ-1, BHQ-2 and BHQ-3, respectively, chosen to ensure minimal spectral overlap (Marras 2006) . Hydrolysis probe sequences were designed concurrently with the primers using AlleleID® v.7 (Premier Biosoft, CA, USA) and were trialled first in uniplex using Precision™ Master Mix without SYBR® Green (Primer Design, Southampton, UK). Optimal probe concentrations were determined as for primer concentration optimisation. The optimal amount of sample (unknown quantity of target) genomic DNA per reaction was defined as the largest amount of total DNA that showed a low C p across all assays but which avoided excessive dilution of samples (thereby not affecting the analytical sensitivity of the assay).",
