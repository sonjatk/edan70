    "text": "Bartonella prevalence across the 193 vampire bats included in this study was 67%. Our phylogenetic analysis of 35 vampire bat Bartonella sequences showed 78.8-100% pairwise identity in gltA and revealed at least 11 paraphyletic genotypes (S2 Table) . BaTS analysis of all Desmodus-associated Bartonella showed significant phylogenetic clustering by country (association index = 3.81, parsimony score = 31.51, p<0.001), although most vampire bat Bartonella genotypes were still widely distributed (Fig 1) . For the 11 genotypes delineated from our 35 sequences, we observed no association with the geographic study region (Ï‡ 2 = 23.3, p = 0.27). Genotypes 1 and 2 were detected across all regions, and genotypes 7-10 were detected within both Belize and Peru, highlighting the broad distribution of vampire bat Bartonella genotypes (Fig 2) ; however, genotype 3 was unique to both regions of Peru, genotypes 4-6 were unique to the western Peruvian Amazon, and genotype 11 was only detected in Belize.",
