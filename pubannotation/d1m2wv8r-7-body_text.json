    "text": "Proteomic based approaches have been widely used to develop extensive cellular protein databases that focus on infection by viruses 16, 17 . However, no such study has been conducted to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in host response to CPV infection. Isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) is an in vitro labelling method that has the capability to compare several time points during a single experiment 18 . The method is considered more sensitive than difference gel electrophoresis, and it has been demonstrated to be effective and accurate in characterising numerous diseases 19, 20 . In this study, we utilised an iTRAQ-labelled mass spectrometry approach to explore the proteomic changes of F81 cells under different cellular growth behaviour induced by CPV infection. Our findings will help to reveal the biological processes of different infection stages and systematically understand the host response under CPV infection.",
