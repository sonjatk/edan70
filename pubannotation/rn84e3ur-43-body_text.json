    "text": "airplane during a cough of the index patient is 1/71 = 0.014, which means b 1 + b 2 â‰¤0.014. By using likelihood analysis, the likelihood values under a range of quanta generation rate, b 1 and b 2 can be obtained (data not shown). The maximum likelihood is 0.763, when the quanta generation rate is 1.36 million, b 1 is 0.014 and b 2 is zero. This likelihood value is much higher than that of the previous cases. So, the risk assessment results will better fit the real case when the movement of the seated passengers is considered. An average walking possibility of 1.4% can be used to represent and simulate the movement behaviors of all the seated passengers.",
