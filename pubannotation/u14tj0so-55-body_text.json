    "text": "To find the memory usage of the programs, we use the Valgrind package [66] and record the total heap usage as memory usage of each program. IPknot and HotKnots are completely written in C and so we can easily find their memory usage by running Valgrind. However, Iterative HFold program is a perl script that runs a few C programs (HFold, HFold-pkonly and SimFold) sequentially. So we find the memory usage of each C component using Valgrind and assign the maximum as the memory usage of Iterative HFold.",
