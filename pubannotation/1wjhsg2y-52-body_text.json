    "text": "Supporting and promoting local scientists in assuming leadership positions and determining the direction of future research endeavors is critical for any successful regional network. Racey [81] discusses a history of foreign-led bat research efforts in non-Western countries, where in many instances, neither permission nor consultation was requested from local researchers. Regarding bat research in Western Asia, there are numerous ways in which foreign organizations can support existing regional institutions. In-country field training, outreach development (e.g., scientific communication), and workshops that promote networking and idea exchange between experts and early career scientists including students, would provide local researchers with the skills and resources necessary to expand on-going research efforts [4] . To this end, WAB-Net aims to support local institutions by: (1) supporting in-region scientists in research topics that they identify as high-priority, (2) assisting young professionals and early career scientists in developing multidisciplinary research skills, (3) conducting all screening of diagnostic samples in regional laboratories to strengthen regional surveillance capacity (currently including the Royal Scientific Society in Amman, Jordan and the R. Lugar Center for Public Health Research in Tbilisi, Georgia), (4) sharing standardized protocols that will be translated into local languages and distributed widely within the region, and (5) engaging with regional policymakers to effectively communicate the relevance of the network's research, and encourage future funding of related efforts.",
