    "text": "flavanone backbone with inhibitory effects on viral neuraminidases (Grienke et al., 2012) may be useful. Because diplacone has a flavanone backbone, structural information on the Cp-NanI-diplacone complex would help in the discovery of viral neuraminidase inhibitors. In this light, we compared the structure of the Cp-NanI CD -diplacone complex with two structures of drug-resistant mutants of viral neuraminidases (the I223R mutant of H1N1 and the H274Y mutant of H5N1) to examine the use of diplacone against influenza viral neuraminidases. Despite the low sequence identity and low homology of viral neuraminidases from influenza A (IA-NA) and B (IB-NA) with Cp-NanI CD (identity: IA-NA, 11.56%; IB-NA, 12.55%; homology: IA-NA, 29.15%; IB-NA, 29.53%), their overall structures are well conserved (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S7a). Moreover, diplacone seems to be accessible regardless of the I223R or the H275Y mutation. The hydroxyl group at the C4 position of diplacone is able to interact with Glu276 of the H275Y mutant as in the wild type, which suggests that diplacone may be a potential lead compound for the development of inhibitors of drug-resistant mutants of viral neuraminidases ( Supplementary Fig. S7b ).",
