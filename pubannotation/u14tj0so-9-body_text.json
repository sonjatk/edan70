    "text": "Incorporating known structural information can improve the accuracy of structure prediction. For example, Mathews et al. [45] used SHAPE reactivity data to improve the prediction accuracy from 26.3% to 86.8% for 5S rRNA of E. coli. Roughly, the larger the SHAPE reactivity value for a given nucleotide, the more likely it is that the nucleotide is unpaired in the structure. However, limited SHAPE reactivity data is available, and the data does not unambiguously determine whether a base is paired or not or, if it is paired, to what other nucleotide. Deigan et al. [46] created pseudo energy terms from SHAPE reactivity data, as a means of integrating such data into prediction software. They reported prediction accuracy of 96% to 100% for three moderate-sized RNAs (< 200 nucleotides) and for 16S rRNA ( 1500 nucleotides). ShapeKnots [47] is a new method for incorporating SHAPE reactivity data for pseudoknotted structures that incorporates the pseudo energy terms into a heuristic method similar to that of Ren et al. [41] .",
