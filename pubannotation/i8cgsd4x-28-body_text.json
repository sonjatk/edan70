    "text": "Total RNA was collected from Hsu cells (control and WNV infected) using Qiagen RNeasy kit following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified and checked for quality using a bioanalyser. The experiment was conducted in duplicate with two RNA-Seq libraries generated for WNV-infected cells and two for uninfected control cells. Sequencing was conducted in a single lane of an Illumina HiSeq2000 (Micromon Facility, Monash University, Australia), generating more than 80 million reads per sample (S1 Table) .",
