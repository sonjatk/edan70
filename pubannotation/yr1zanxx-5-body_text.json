    "text": "Microglia are the resident immune cells in the CNS, originating from yolk sac progenitor cells that seed the brain early in development [9] . In addition to a multitude of homeostatic functions throughout development and healthy aging [10, 11] , microglia participate in both innate and adaptive immune responses through recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns [12] , which stimulate morphological changes [13, 14] and increase production of reactive oxidative species [15, 16] and cytokines/chemokines [17, 18] . During neurotropic virus infection, virally infected cells secrete chemokines including CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10, which facilitate immune cells crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB) [19] [20] [21] . Mononuclear cell infiltration into the CNS is a hallmark of WNV encephalitis, and monocytes and T cells are critical for CNS virologic control. Elimination of monocytes using a liposome-encapsulated drug dichloromethylene diphosphonate or by genetic deletion of CCR2 increases mortality in mice infected with a neurotropic strain of WNV [22, 23] . However, monocytes may also contribute to dissemination of virus to the CNS [24, 25] , and inhibition of monocyte infiltration may also protect against nitric oxide-mediated immunopathology [26] . CD4 + T cells produce antiviral molecules, such as interferon γ (IFNγ) and IL-2, which promotes antiviral humoral immunity and sustains WNV-specific CD8 + T cell responses, enabling viral clearance in all organs [27, 28] . CD8 + T cells contribute to viral clearance and recovery from WNV infection via both cytopathic and noncytopathic mechanisms [29] [30] [31] [32] . Mice lacking either CD8 + T cells or MHC-I molecules have higher CNS viral burdens, increased mortality after infection, and prolonged viral persistence, suggesting that cell-mediated immunity controls virus within the CNS [32] .",
