    "text": "The main idea of filter-based methods is to create a detection process {D k,t }, for each time point t, which is a weighted average of the diagnostic or syndromic data to be used for the detection of an outbreak signature. The weights that appear in {D k,t } are defined using the form of the time series model and a filter, {a l } say. Extreme positive values of the detection process at a time point indicate a possible outbreak signature. The definition of the detection processes has its origin in process control [5] , and is popularly used in the context of biosurveillance [1] [2] [3] [4] 6, 8] . Naturally, the form of the filter has an important effect in the detection process.",
