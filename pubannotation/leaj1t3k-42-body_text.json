    "text": "A number of CPPs are derived from viral proteins, such tat, VP22, and FHV. The role of these cell penetrating motifs during infection has yet to be elucidated but it is interesting to see that another obligate intracellular pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, also possesses a cell wall protein with such a peptide sequence [25] . CPPs represent an example of how understanding how pathogens interact with human host cells can lead to new ways to treat and prevent viral infections.",
