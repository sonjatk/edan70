    "text": "Background: Cyclooxygenase-2-derived prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), a bioactive eicosanoid, has been implicated in many biological processes including reproduction, inflammation and tumor growth. We previously showed that PGE 2 stimulated lung cancer cell growth and progression through PGE 2 receptor EP2/EP4-mediated kinase signaling pathways. However, the role of PGE 2 in controlling lung airway epithelial cell phenotype remains unknown. We evaluated the effects of c-Jun and 3-phosphoinositede dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) in mediating epithelial cell hyperplasia induced by PGE 2 .",
