Viral titers of both treatment groups were significantly higher than in the control group (p < 0.0001, Bonferroni post hoc test), but there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups (p = 0.53, Bonferroni post hoc test). The significant interaction between treatment and sampling week indicates that the slope of the viral titer decrease was dependent on treatment. 9.47 ± 0.51 [6] 8.47 ± 0.48 [6] 8.01 ± 0.65 [6] 7.12 ± 0.65 [6] 3.",
