    "text": "To assess the role in PRF of sequences 3 of the slippery sequence, a series of in-frame deletions were introduced into pDluc/PRRSV, starting from the 3 end of the inserted PRRSV sequence. RNAs transcribed from these plasmids were translated in RRL in the presence of nsp1␤ ( Figure  2A ). PRF was found to be unaffected until the length of the PRRSV sequence downstream of the slippery sequence fell below 21 nt, at which point PRF was reduced (18 nt) or abolished (15 or 9 nt). In the latter constructs, the C-rich region is compromised, consistent with an important role in PRF. Similar results were previously observed in transfected cultured cells (Li et al., (19) ). To investigate the function of the C-rich region specifically, we prepared a library of individual point mutations within, and flanking, the Crich region and assessed their effect on PRF ( Figure 2B ). It was found that changing any of the C residues to G had a detrimental effect on PRF, with the exception of the final residue (C 13 , 3 of the conserved sequence), where the effect was more modest. As an explanation for these observations, we speculated that the RNA downstream of the slippery sequence may interact with PCBPs. The 'minimal' region of PRRSV RNA required for full activity in PRF (21 nt) has only two C-rich patches, whereas previously established PCBP-binding consensus sequences more commonly have three (or more) C-triplets, potentially with each triplet binding one KH domain ((33); see below). However, PCBP1 and PCBP2 are amongst several candidates reported to associate with GST-tagged nsp1␤ in association screens, and a direct physical interaction between the two has been shown (34, 35) . PCBPs could therefore bind to the PRRSV mRNA by virtue of an association with nsp1␤.",
