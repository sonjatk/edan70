    "text": "Tnni3 can be used to identify a pulmonary myocardium gene network Since the expression of TNNI3 has previously been used as a marker for pulmonary myocardium (Millino et al. 2000; Mommersteeg et al. 2007; Ye et al. 2015) , we reasoned that genes with expression that correlated with Tnni3 expression (trait ID 1422536_at, mean expression 11.552) Figure 1 Identification of a pulmonary myocardium gene network. The top 100 transcripts that correlated with Tnni3 in the BXD whole-lung transcriptome data set were used to generate a network graph. This resulted in a network of 24 transcripts with a Pearson correlation .0.8. (A) These 24 transcripts were subsequently regraphed to interrogate relationships at Pearson correlation values between 0.7 and 1.0 (red lines) and between 0.5 and 0.7 (orange lines). (B) The functional relationships of the 21 proteins translated from these 24 transcripts were also identified. All proteins except DOC2G and MYBPHL had known roles in cardiac function including structural sarcomeric proteins, regulation of sarcomere assembly, ion transport, transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, and hormone signaling.",
