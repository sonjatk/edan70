    "text": "HEV infection results in an acute, self-limiting and icteric disease that is prevalent in much of the developing world. Although self-limiting infection occurs in adults with mortality rate~1-2%, a high 10-20% mortality rate is observed during pregnancy [6] . Hence it is important to understand the molecular mechanism by which HEV completes its life cycle inside the host. A recent study done by Prusty and coworkers revealed that NF-κB activity is inhibited in the PBMC and liver of fulminant hepatic failure patients [9] . Our findings that the ORF2 protein has the ability to inhibit NF-κB activity in human hepatoma cells provide a possible molecular explanation to their observation.",
