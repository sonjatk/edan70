    "text": "Given the zoonotic potential of bat-associated Bartonella, understanding transmission within bats is critical for understanding how Bartonella persists in bat populations and for assessing spillover risks [22, 23] . Ectoparasites are frequently invoked as a transmission route [12, 19, 24] , in part because vector-borne transmission occurs in other taxa [25, 26] and because Bartonella has been identified in bat flies and ticks [27] [28] [29] . While some bat ticks can feed on humans [30] , the high host specificity of bat flies [31, 32] could limit opportunities for crossspecies transmission through ectoparasites [31] [32] [33] . Transmission through close contact (e.g., biting) could occur given detection of Bartonella in dog and cat saliva [34, 35] as well as human infection following scratches from dogs and cats [36] . Phylogenetic patterns of weak Bartonella host specificity in Neotropical bat communities could not only reflect transmission through close contacts between species in multi-species roosts, but could also stem from transmission through generalist vectors [15, 24, 37] . Bartonella might also be transmitted through exposure to feces between bats and to humans that enter roosts or to domestic animals exposed to bat feces [18, 38] .",
