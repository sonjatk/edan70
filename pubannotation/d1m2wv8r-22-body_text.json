    "text": "The anti-cancer activity of CPV is closely related to its apoptosis-inducing effect. A previous study has shown that CPV2 NS1 induces apoptosis mainly through the mitochondrial pathway 37 . Coincidently, we found that BAK1 was up-regulated at 48 hpi and 60 hpi in this study. BAK is a pro-apoptotic regulator that plays a central role in mitochondrial membrane permeabilisation 38 . It suppresses tumourigenesis by mediating apoptosis of tumour cells 39 . For example, BAK over-expression can effectively induce apoptosis in gastric cancer cells 40 . Also, elevations in BAK protein levels have been shown to accelerate apoptosis in murine lymphoid, lung cancer, and breast cancer cells 41 . In addition, VDAC2, which can recruit newly synthesised BAK to the mitochondria to carry out apoptosis 42 , was also up-regulated at 48 hpi and 60 hpi in our study. These findings remind us that the anti-cancer activity of CPV may be closely related to the over-expression of BAK1 and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway that is mediated by it. Lakshman Santra et al. suggest that CPV2 NS1 might be effective against tumours with the p53 mutation 43 . As a critical effector of apoptosis, BAK can participate in the apoptotic process without activation of p53. Therefore, over-expression of the bak gene may be a new strategy for the treatment of tumours, especially for tumours bearing p53 mutations.",
