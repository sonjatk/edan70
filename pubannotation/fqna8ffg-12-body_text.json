    "text": "As depicted in Fig. 3 , BAL cell differentiation revealed an acute, neutrophilic pulmonary inflammation, where neutrophilic granulocytes (PMNs) represent the most significant cell accumulation with 0.25 × 10 6 PMNs 24 h after CNP instillation. Nevertheless, also 3 h after CNP, the first time point analyzed, a smaller number of 0.04 × 10 6 PMNs could be detected, whereas PMNs were basically undetectable in untreated controls (below 1 %; <2 × 10 3 cells). The increase in BAL PMN numbers was most dynamic from 12 to 18 h after treatment, with a significant increase from 0.10 to 0.23 x10 6 PMNs within 6 h. Lymphocyte numbers were nearly undetectable (<1 % of total BAL cells) and macrophages showed a noticeable decline at the 12 h time point and an increase after 24 h only. The acute inflammatory response resolved over time, reaching BAL neutrophil levels similar to baseline by day 7.",
