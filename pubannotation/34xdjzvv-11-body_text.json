    "text": "Interestingly, elevated IL-6 was shown in the spinal cord but not brainstem or muscle of infected mice (untreated group vs. isotypetreated group). Treatment of N3 effectively reduced the elevated IL-6 expression in the spinal cord and even reduced the basal level of IL-6 in the muscle (Fig. 7C ). These chemokines downregulated markedly in CNS and limb muscle indicated that treatment with N3 at an early stage of 5746 infection hindered viral-induced pathogenesis, and might affect the lymphocyte infiltration in the inflammatory tissues.",
