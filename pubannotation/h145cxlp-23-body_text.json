    "text": "In our study, about two-thirds of influenza cases and all fatalities were A(H1N1)pdm09-associated. During the postpandemic seasons 1/2/3, the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 cases among the PICU patients was 79 %/14 %/65 % and, thus, considerably higher than the proportion of this subtype reported among outpatients by national influenza surveillance (65 %/1 %/34 %) [17] . This observation suggests that A(H1N1)pdm09 may be associated more often with a severe course of influenza requiring PICU treatment than other influenza types/ subtypes. Similar observations on the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09-associated PICU admissions have been reported in the United States [9] .",
