    "text": "In this work we present a new method that addresses these shortcomings. Our method, Iterative HFold, takes a pseudoknot-free input structure and produces a possibly pseudoknotted structure whose energy is at least as low as that of any (density-2) pseudoknotted structure containing the input structure. Iterative HFold incorporates four different methods and reports as its final structure the structure with the lowest energy, among all structures produced by these methods. While one of its underlying methods, HFold, strictly adheres to the hierarchical folding hypothesis, the other three use iterations to extend or remove the base pairs of input structure, with the goal of finding a structure that has lower energy than the structure found by HFold. Thus, unlike HFold, iterative HFold is able to modify the input structure (while the class of structures handled by both methods is the same). This is valuable since 1) computationally produced structures may not be completely accurate and 2) while the hierarchical folding hypothesis is a useful guiding principle, there is evidence that allowing for disruption of some base pairs in the initially formed pseudoknot-free secondary structure can improve prediction [53, 54] .",
