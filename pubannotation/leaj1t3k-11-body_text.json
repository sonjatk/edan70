    "text": "Peptide-mediated PMO delivery has been the focus of intense efforts to identify active, stable, non toxic and endosomolytic CPPs, of which (RXR) 4 XB (also called P7; R = L-arginine, X = 6-aminohexanoic acid; B = β-alanine) has proven very successful [61, 62] . In antiviral studies, PMOs have been covalently linked to various arginine-rich peptides, the most frequent being R 9 F 2 C (R = L-arginine; F = L-phenylalanine; C = L-cysteine), R 5 F 2 R 4 C (also called P4), and (RXR) 4 XB. Conjugation is mainly at the 5'-terminal end of the PMO. In studies comparing the activity of various CPPs against murine hepatitis virus (MHV) [63] and Ebola virus (EBOV) [64] , arginine-rich peptides with insertions of 6-aminohexanoic acid stood out for their in vi vo effectiveness. The higher the number of arginine-6aminohexanoic repeats, the higher were PMO antiviral effect on MHV in cell culture [63] and the protection against EBOV infection in mice [64] . These findings agree with the results from Amantana et a l. [57] , Abes et al. [61] and Youngblood et al. [65] , who also found that these residues increased serum stability and enhanced endosomal escape of the conjugates. Burrer et al. documented that the nature of the linker (XB or cysteine) did not affect PPMO in v itro effectiveness against MHV or cytotoxicity, although the insertion of β-alanine residues was reported to improve both serum and intracellular stability of PPMO conjugates [65] .",
