    "text": "Because we found that HCV protein reduction in the liver required CD8 T cells, we tested whether HCV-specific CD8 T cells were present in splenocytes 28 days after immunization. To determine the functional reactivity of HCV-specific CD8 + T cells, we performed a CD107a mobilization assay and intracellular IFNc staining. CN2-29 transgenic mice expressed the HCV structural protein and the NS2 region. However, rVV-N25 comprised only Isolated splenocytes from immunized mice were co-cultured with EL-4CN2 or EL-4NS2 cell lines for 2 weeks and analyzed.",
