    "text": "ETEC is the most common cause of PWD in pigs. This pathotype is characterized by the production of enterotoxins and adhesins, both essential for disease development. Enterotoxins produced by ETEC may be heat stable [STa, STb, or enteroaggregative E. coli heat stable enterotoxin 1 (EAST1)] or heat labile (LT) [2] . Enterotoxin genes are on plasmids of ETEC bacteria and act on the intestinal epithelium of pigs [7] .",
