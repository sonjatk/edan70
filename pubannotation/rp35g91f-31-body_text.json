    "text": "To further define transcriptional programs that might specify pulmonary myocardium identity, we performed transcription factor binding site enrichment analysis. We used the oPOSSUM-3 Web-based tool (Kwon et al. 2012) to identify overrepresented, conserved transcription factor binding sites in our set of 21 pulmonary myocardium genes and five candidate modifier genes. The pulmonary myocardium gene network was enriched in binding site sequences for SRF (serum response n ",
