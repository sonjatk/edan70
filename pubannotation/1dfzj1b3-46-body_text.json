    "text": "The most commonly used DPPH assay is simple and highly sensitive. DPPH is commercialised in the radical form due to its stability. This radical shows a strong absorption maximum at 517 nm (purple). In the presence of antioxidants, the colour turns from purple to yellow. Therefore the sole equipment needed for the assay is a UV-Vis spectrophotometer.",
