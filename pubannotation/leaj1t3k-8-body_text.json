    "text": "What makes these peptides very attractive as a delivery system is their ability to promote intracellular uptake of conjugated cargoes [32] . CPPs have successfully improved the cellular uptake of various cargoes including proteins [26, 33] , nucleic acids (oligonucleotides [34, 35] , peptide-nucleic acids [36, 37] , siRNAs [38, 39] ), nanoparticules [40] and liposomes [41] in a wide range of cells: mainly in mammalian cells, but also in bacteria [37, 42] , yeasts [42] and protozoan parasites [43, 44] . CPPs have proven to be very efficient in delivering molecules into cells that are refractory to transfection such as primary lymphocytes [45] . In 1999, Schwarze et a l. successfully delivered into all tissues in mice the 120-kDa tat-conjugated Î²-galactosidase protein, which retained its enzymatic activity [46] . Impressively, the conjugate had also crossed the blood-brain barrier and reached the brain tissues, which is usually restricted to small and highly lipophilic peptides. CPPs offer the opportunity to deliver therapeutic molecules that are 200 times larger than the current bioavailability size restriction [45] . CPP-mediated delivery of bioactive compounds into model organisms for cancer [47] , cardiomyopathy [48] , stroke [49] , muscular dystrophy [50] and viral infections, support the strong therapeutic potential exerted by CPPs. Clinical trials are taking CPP-based drugs a step closer to therapeutic applications. An heptamer arginineconjugated cyclosporine A (Psorban) has entered phase II of a clinical trial for topical treatment of psoriasis [29, 51] . The oligoarginine peptide allows the penetration of cyclosporine A into cells throughout the otherwise impermeable epidermis and dermis. This review will focus on studies that explored the use of CPPs to deliver antisense agents into virusinfected cells and animal models (Table 1) . ",
