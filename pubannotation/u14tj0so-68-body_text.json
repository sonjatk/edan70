    "text": "In Section 'Comparison with Hotknots and IPknot' we provide more insight on the differences and merits of Iterative HFold, HotKnots and IPknots. Then in Section 'Comparison with ShapeKnots' we compare accuracy of Iterative HFold with ShapeKnots, a method that incorporates SHAPE reactivity data to predict RNA pseudoknotted secondary structure. In Section 'Iterative HFold with SimFold's suboptimal structures' we compare performance accuracy of Iterative HFold with two inputs: HotKnots hotspots and suboptimal structures. Section 'Energy model' provides more insight into the energy model used in this work.",
