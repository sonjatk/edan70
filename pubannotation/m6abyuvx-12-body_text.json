    "text": "In addition, we measured serum ALT levels in CN2-29 (+/2) / MxCre (+/2) mice from all four treatment groups 28 days after rVV-HCV immunization. Serum ALT levels were not significant- (+/2) and the Cremediated activation of the transgene unit. R6CN2 HCV cDNA was cloned downstream of the CAG promoter, neomycin-resistant gene (neo), and poly A (pA) signal flanked by two loxP sequences. This cDNA contains the core, E1, E2, and NS2 regions. (B) Cre-mediated genomic DNA recombination. After poly(I:C) injection, genomic DNA was extracted from liver tissues and analyzed by quantitative RTD-PCR for Cre-mediated transgenic recombination. The transgene was almost fully recombined in transgenic mouse livers 7 days after the injection. In all cases, n = 3 mice per group. (C) HCV core protein expression was sustained for at least 600 days after poly(I:C) injection. (D) Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that most hepatocytes expressed the HCV core protein within 6 days after injection. (E) Liver sections from CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice after the poly(I:C) injection. Infiltrating lymphocytes (arrows) were observed on days 6 and 180; Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was observed on day 360. In contrast, these pathological changes were not observed in CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (2/2) mice after the injection. The inset image shows abnormal mitosis in a tumor cell. (F) Hepatocyte swelling and abnormal architecture of liver-cell cords (silver staining), as well as abnormal glycogen accumulation (PAS staining) were observed on day 90 in CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice. We observed steatosis (oil-red-O staining) on day 180 and, subsequently, fibrosis (Azan staining) on day 480. The scale bars indicate 50 mm. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0051656.g001 ly different in the rVV-N25-treated mice and control mice ( Figure 3C ); this finding indicated that rVV-N25 treatment did not cause liver injury and that the antiviral effect was independent of hepatocyte destruction.",
