    "text": "In spite of reports of a number of structures of sialidases from bacteria (Crennell et al., 1993 (Crennell et al., , 1994 Gaskell et al., 1995) , viruses (Varghese et al., 1983; Burmeister et al., 1993; Crennell et al., 2000) and humans (Chavas et al., 2005) , elucidation of the binding mode of bacterial sialidase inhibitors is limited owing to the absence of structural information (Taylor, 1996) . In order to understand how natural geranylated flavonoids interact with sialidase, we determined the crystal structure of the Cp-NanI catalytic domain (NanI CD ; residues 243-694) in complex with diplacone at 1.9 Ã… resolution. The structural information on Cp-NanI CD and comparison with the models of human sialidases provide an insight into how the natural geranylated flavonoids can behave as antibiotics and led to the elucidation of a strategy for the design of advanced inhibitors for the treatment of infectious diseases caused by C. perfringens.",
