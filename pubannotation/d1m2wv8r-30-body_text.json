    "text": "Additionally, to reduce the complexity of the peptide mixtures, reverse-phase chromatography using a RIGOL L-3000 system was applied for separating the peptides. The labeled peptide mixtures were dissolved in 100 μ L of mobile phase A [2% acetonitrile in ddH 2 O, pH 10] and centrifuged at 14,000 g for 20 min prior to loading onto the column. Samples were eluted by injection of stepwise gradients of mobile phase B [2% ddH 2 O in acetonitrile, pH 10], with a flow rate set at 700 μ L/min. Each fraction was eluted for 1.5 min. Analysis by Q-Exactive mass spectrometry. The fractionated peptide mixtures were analysed by a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer equipped with an EASY-nLC 1000 System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The spray voltage, capillary temperature, and declustering potential of the source ionisation parameters were set as 2.1 kV, 250 °C, and 100 V, respectively.",
