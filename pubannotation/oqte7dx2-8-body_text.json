    "text": "USP46 is also implicated in regulating the GABAergic system in mice. Tomida et al. (2009) discovered that an inbred strain of mice (CS strain) known to have defects in circadian rhythms, also exhibits changes in depression-like behaviors consistent with an anti-depressive state. Quantitative trait locus mapping of the CS mice identified a 3bp deletion in a conserved lysine ( K92) in USP46. Importantly, USP46 knock-out (KO) mice exhibit similar changes in depression-like behaviors (Imai et al., 2013) and broad expression of a wild type USP46 transgene in CS mice rescued these behaviors (Tomida et al., 2009) . The magnitude of behavioral effects in the USP46 ( K92) mutant mice were not as strong as those observed in USP46 KO mice (Imai et al., 2013) , suggesting that the K92 mutation does not completely eliminate USP46 activity. Indeed, in vitro deubiquitination assays revealed that USP46( K92) still retains some enzymatic activity (Zhang et al., 2011) .",
