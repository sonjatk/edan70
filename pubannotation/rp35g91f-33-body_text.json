    "text": "We subsequently investigated the expression of Nkx2-5, Srf, Mef2a, Tead1, and Nr2f1 in the lung using the Fantom5 mouse promoterome database (data not shown). At the transcript level, the expression of all factors except Nkx2-5 could be detected in the lung (lung, adult: CNhs10474 ctss). The absence of Nkx2-5 expression in adult lung is an apparent paradox since this factor has previously been shown to be required for pulmonary myocardium identity (Millino et al. 2000; Mommersteeg et al. 2007 ). However, whether the lung sections sampled in the Fantom5 project actually contain pulmonary myocardium cannot be determined. In contrast, Nkx2-5 low-level expression in the BXD lung data set could be detected with a mean of 7.798 log 2 units [background is generally considered to be ,7 log 2 units (Geisert et al. 2009) ]. Further, Nkx2-5 expression in the lung data set was significantly positively correlated with almost all the members of the pulmonary myocardium gene network (Table 4 ).",
