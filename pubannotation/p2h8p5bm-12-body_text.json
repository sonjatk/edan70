    "text": "OHFV distribution is restricted to western Siberia ( Figure 1 ) [17] . The main vector of OHFV is the meadow tick, Dermacentor reticulatus, which can also transmit the virus to humans. However, humans are mainly infected after contact with infected muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) which are very sensitive to the infection and often succumb to the infection [63] . Muskrats develop high viremia which can last for several weeks. Human infection occurs through contact with urine, feces, and blood [63] . Secretion of OHFV in unpasteurized goat milk has been reported but no milk-borne outbreaks have been observed [63] . The exact number of annual cases are uncertain because of misdiagnoses and unreported cases, but 165 cases were reported between 1988 and 1997 [63] . OHFV may cause a biphasic disease; the initial phase is characterized by high fever, bleeding from the nose, mouth, and uterus. Thirty to fifty percent of the cases experience a second phase characterized by high fever and reappearance of the symptoms from the initial phase. Case fatality rates range from 0.5 to 2.5% [63] . No antiviral treatments are available against OHFV, instead treatment is focused on supportive care to minimize hemorrhage and other complications [17] .",
