    "text": "If a ubiquitous childhood virus is the cause of KD, the mode of entry would likely be a common mode of infection such as fecal-oral or respiratory spread. To note, mild upper respiratory symptoms have been described in up to 35% of cases [36] with rare but more significant pulmonary disease also being reported [37] . Additionally, outbreaks in the United States have been associated with preceding viral illness [38] . Notably, however, concomitant respiratory viruses are only shown in 9% of cases [39] , and in the same study that showed 35% with respiratory symptoms, 61% were noted to have gastrointestinal complaints.",
