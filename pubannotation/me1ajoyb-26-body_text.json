    "text": "The use of monoclonal antibodies has been particularly challenging for hantavirus/reservoir research. Identification of cell surface markers could shed light on what cells respond during hantavirus infection of reservoir hosts. While cell surface antigens tend to be more divergent, intracellular proteins, such as antiviral proteins, tend to be more conserved, particularly phosphoepitopes. Thus, it is likely that many available antibodies to house mouse (Mus musculus) or Norway rat antiviral proteins will be cross-reactive with orthologs from hantavirus rodent reservoir species. Without information as to which proteins may be of interest, screening of antibodies is a daunting and expensive task since most likely will not be informative. However, combined with RNA-Seq and metabolomic data, it is likely that target proteins and pathways can be identified so that investigators can focus their efforts and resources. In addition, software tools can help predict whether antibodies may be cross-reactive to proteins from reservoir hosts [109] .",
