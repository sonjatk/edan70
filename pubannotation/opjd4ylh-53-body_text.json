    "text": "The findings of this study show that nurses were scared to come into contact with TB patients. As a result, they tend to spend less time with them. Nurses tend to neglect patients because of fear of getting infected and they provide less nursing care to those patients. According to the study done by Valjee and van Dyk [2] , healthcare workers express a sense of physical and mental exhaustion and stress from dealing with HIV/AIDS patients that need serious attention and care. The findings of this study concur with those of a study by Wyzgowski et al. [24] which showed that HIV/AIDS patients often tried to expose the nurses and their relatives to their blood and fluids on purpose.",
