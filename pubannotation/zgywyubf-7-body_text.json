    "text": "In order to test whether ORF2 or ORF3 protein of HEV inhibit cellular NF-κB activity, a reporter vector with IL-2 receptor promoter region, which contains NF-κB element, cloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase coding sequence (NF-κB CAT; [10] was used. This vector was inducible by NF-κB activating agents like TPA or IL-1β. Huh7 cells were transiently transfected with the NF-κB CAT vector along with either ORF2 or ORF3 expression plasmids. Assay of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) activity using these cell extracts revealed that ORF2 protein inhibited the NF-κB CAT activity ( Figure 1A ). However, no inhibition was observed by ORF3 expression ( Figure 1A ). In order to investigate whether ORF2 mediated inhibition of NF-κB activity was an artifact of the experimental system, cells were treated for 30 minutes with Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA), a known inducer of NF-κB activity [11] , or transfected with an expression construct of IκB kinase β, which is the catalytic subunit of the IKK complex that acts as a constitutively active inducer of NF-κB activity [12] . TPA treatment increased NF-κB activity of mock transfected cells by approximately 4 folds whereas ORF2 expressing cells did not show any significant increase in NF-κB activity ( Figure 1A) . Similarly, co-expression of ORF2 in IKKβ transfected cells resulted in downregulation of NF-κB activity in comparison to cells transfected with only IKKβ ( Figure 1B) . These results clearly suggest that HEV ORF2 inhibits NF-κB activity.",
