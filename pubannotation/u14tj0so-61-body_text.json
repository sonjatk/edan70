    "text": "Often, partial information about G big is not available; this is the case for many RNAs of unknown function reported by the ENCODE consortium [24] . Therefore, we next compare the quality of results obtained by HFold, HFold-PKonly and Iterative HFold when given a pseudoknot-free input, G that is predicted by existing computational methods. One way to produce an input structure is to use an MFE pseudoknot-free structure prediction method, such as MFold. We chose SimFold as it is an implementation of MFold and, because of its energy parameters, gives more accurate predictions than MFold. Of course, when comparative information is available, the user can input such information as structural constraint as a pseudoknot-free structure to Iterative HFold and expect a better prediction result. Here we compare two methods for predicting G, namely SimFold and the hotspots produced by HotKnots V2.0. Table 2 reports the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence intervals of average F-measures. The accuracy of HFold-PKonly is significantly worse than that of HFold and Iterative HFold, both with the output of SimFold, and with the HotKnots hotspots as input, so we do not discuss HFold-PKonly further.",
