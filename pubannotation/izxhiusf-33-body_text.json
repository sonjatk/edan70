    "text": "In contrast to viral infections, which are known to be associated with wheezing in young children, bacterial infections have long been considered of no importance in asthma and wheezing, and antibiotic therapy is not recommended in current asthma treatment guidelines [17] [18] [19] [20] . However, several studies suggest that bacteria might play a role in wheezing in young children [9, 10, 17, 19, 20] . Moreover, it is increasingly appreciated that the human body is home to an extended microbiome, with asthmatic children harbouring different bacteria and a less diverse mix compared to healthy children [21] . Characterisation of the predominant bacteria in wheezing children is essential to understand the pathophysiology of persistent wheezing.",
