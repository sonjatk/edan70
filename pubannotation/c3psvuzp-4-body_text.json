    "text": "One function of ADP-ribosylation may be to regulate viral infectivity and pathogenesis, consistent with the role of other PTMs in immunity. For example, both vaccinia virus [17] and herpes simplex virus [18] require ADP-ribosylation activity for viral replication. Moreover, diverse RNA viruses, such as alphaviruses, hepatitis E virus, rubella virus and SARS coronavirus encode one or more macrodomains, potentially conferring the ability to specifically recognize, and possibly reverse, ADPribosylation upon these viruses [19] . Mutations in the macrodomain of Sindbis virus led to reduced virulence in mice [20] . Similarly, mutations in the SARS coronavirus macrodomain sensitized the virus to the antiviral effects of the signaling cytokine, interferon (IFN) [21] . As IFN functions as one of the primary mediators of the innate immune system against viruses [22] , these results indicate that macrodomains, and therefore ADP-ribosylation, could be important viral regulators of host immunity. Moreover, host PARP genes can play a direct role in antiviral immunity. For example, overexpression of PARP13, also known as ZAP or ZC3HAV1 (Zinc-finger CCCH-type antiviral protein 1), is sufficient to restrict replication of several different families of viruses, including a retrovirus (murine leukemia virus [23] ), filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg [24] ), a togavirus (Sindbis [25] ) and a hepadnavirus (Hepatitis B virus [26] ). This antiviral activity is mediated through direct binding of viral RNA by PARP13, followed by recruitment of the exosome and specific degradation of viral RNA [27, 28] , although more recently, additional signaling roles for PARP13 have been proposed [14, 29] . Beyond the welldescribed PARP13-mediated antiviral functions, PARP1, 7, 10 and 12 have been shown to play roles in repressing viral replication [30, 31, 32, 33] , although the mechanisms of these antiviral actions are unknown. While these results indicate that there may be a role for individual PARPs in regulating viral infectivity or pathogenesis, there has been no cohesive model for how ADP-ribosylation may influence host-viral interactions.",
