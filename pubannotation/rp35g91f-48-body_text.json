    "text": "Taken together, a model is proposed whereby hemodynamic stress triggers mechanosensory (stretch-stress) signaling from the sarcomere and initiates NO signaling cascades from the adjacent pulmonary epithelia, which are transmitted back to the pulmonary myocardium myocyte nuclei ( Figure 5 ). This leads to dynamic regulation of gene expression, enabling fine-tuning of the contractile properties of the pulmonary myocardium, such as the rate and force of contraction, as well as influencing blood volume, ion transport, and hormone signaling. Our findings indicate that genetic variability at these loci can modify levels of gene expression in the pulmonary myocardium, and could modify venous return to the left atrium as well as pathological features such as hypertrophy, fibrosis, and initiation of ectopic beats. Hence the genes/loci identified in this study could be linked to atrial fibrillation in humans triggered by pulmonary events. Indeed, these loci regulate genes that in humans are known to be associated with various heart diseases (dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmia) and are therefore viable candidates for involvement in the pathobiology of atrial fibrillation.
