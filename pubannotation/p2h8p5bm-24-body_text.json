    "text": "Little is known about the role of the TLR7/8-Myd88 pathway in tick-borne flavivirus infection; however, TLR7 was shown to suppress LGTV replication within neurons of the brain although it did not affect pathogenesis [132] . What we are aware of; no animal experiments have shown any significance of the TLR3-TRIF pathway in tick-borne flavivirus infection. However, several studies have looked at the prevalence of polymorphisms in the TLR3 gene in TBE patients [133] [134] [135] [136] . In particular, one polymorphism has been investigated the T allele in rs3775291. This polymorphism has been shown to reduce TLR3 signaling by about 30% [137] . Although the data regarding TLR3 is somewhat conflicting, Grygorczuk et al. hypothesized that a functional TLR3 facilitates the onset of neurological disease [135] by supporting the penetration through the blood brain barrier, but has a protective effect during the established CNS infection [134] . The differences between studies might also be connected to the different subtypes of the TBEV strain and the genetic background of the studied populations [134] .",
