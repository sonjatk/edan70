    "text": "Not all PCBPs were capable of stimulating PRF. The lack of activity of PCBP4 and hnRNP K/J is potentially a consequence of differences in overall size and domain organization. PCBP1, 2 and 3 are globally similar, with KH domains located at analogous positions in the protein, whereas the linker separating KH2 and KH3 is shorter in PCBP4 and much longer in hnRNP K/J ( Figure 3D ). These differences did not affect association of PCPB4 with nsp1␤, but could affect the strength of binding of individual KH domains to RNA or alternatively, preclude generation of a correctly oriented or positioned complex on the mRNA. With the KH domain mutants of PCBP1 and PCBP2, we largely observed an excellent correlation between activity in RNA binding, ribosomal pausing and the capacity to induce PRF. However, we saw differential activity in PRF of the KH1 domain mutants of PCBP1 and PCBP2, with the former barely active yet the latter retaining function in promoting −1 PRF, but with reduced −2 PRF. When RNA association was examined by EMSA, PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP2 KH1m bound to the PRRSV RNA with similar affinity and in an nsp1␤-dependent manner, although binding was noticeably reduced in comparison to the WT proteins. This suggests that PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP2 KH1m still associate with the RNA, but the stability, conformation or position of the complex may be changed such that only in the case of PCBP2 KH1m is PRF possible, and only −1 PRF (which is the predominant frameshift event for WT PCBP2 at the natural spacing distance). As noted in the 'Results' section, compensatory activity in PRF was detected upon mixing the individually inactive PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP1 KH3m , suggesting that two (or more) PCBPs can cooperate to stimulate frameshifting. The differential activity of PCBP1 KH1m and PCBP2 KH1m could reflect an altered capacity to homo-oligomerize.",
