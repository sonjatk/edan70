    "text": "Viral replication often is integrally associated with the cell cycle status of host cells (Feuer et al., 2002) . To explore the possible benefits of different cell cycle phases for EV-D68 viral replication, we synchronized cells in different phases and then assessed viral replication and virulence. First, we assessed the effects of G0/G1 synchronization by serum deprivation (Darzynkiewicz et al., 1980) . RD cells were cultured in either serum medium (control) or serum-free medium (G0/G1 synchronization) for 24 h. Then the cells were infected with the same titer of 0.8 MOI of EV-D68 (Fermon strain) or were mock-infected for 2 h, and either serum medium or serum-free medium was added for another 24 h ( Figure 1A ). As previously reported (He et al., 2010) , serum deprivation induced obvious G0/G1 arrest as assessed by flow cytometry (P < 0.001; Figure 1B ). At 2 h post-infection (viral entry stage), the EV-D68 genomic RNA levels were not significantly different in the control and serumstarved cells ( Figure 1M) ; however, at 18 h post infection (viral replication stage) 13.55 times more viral RNA was detected in the serum-starved cells than in the control cells (P < 0.01; Figure 1C ). Furthermore, at 24 h (viral production stage) the TCID50/mL of infectious EV-D68 particles was 348.84 times higher for supernatant from G0/G1 phase-synchronized cells (202.17 ± 42.60 × 10 5 ) than for supernatant from control cells (0.59 ± 0.08 × 10 5 ) (P < 0.01; Figure 1D ). These results suggest that G0/G1-phase arrest does not affect viral entry, but promotes EV-D68 viral replication and production.",
