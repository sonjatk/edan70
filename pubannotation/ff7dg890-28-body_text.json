    "text": "The use of models in epidemiology dates back almost a century, and while traditional models have often been highly successful in explaining observed dynamics [17, 20, 28, 29, 41] , our results show that within a strict management setting, epidemiological details can make a crucial difference. Although a body of theoretical work [25, 26, 30] has demonstrated the importance of incorporating realistic distributions of latent and infectious periods into models of endemic disease, few studies have considered the effects associated with making predictions for an emerging disease [42] .",
