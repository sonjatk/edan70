    "text": "Our assay detected SQPV with comparable results to the Atkin et al. (2010) SYBRÂ® green assay, showing good qualitative agreement; k value (agreement) of 0.75 (n = 7) and 1.00 (n = 12) for grey and red squirrel assays, respectively. In comparing the quantitative values (i.e. C p values) of the developed SQPV assays and the Atkin et al. (2010) assay, strong correlation was witnessed (r = 1.00 and 0.99 for grey and red squirrel assays, respectively). By contrast, we found only moderate agreement between qualitative results of SADV detected in tissues by TEM and our assay results (k value = 0.39, n = 15; red squirrel SADV assay). In fact, none of the grey squirrel tissues tested (n = 5) showed evidence of SADV viral particles by TEM, which was not surprising due to the asymptomatic nature of the infection in the grey squirrel. By contrast, the k value between the developed red and grey squirrel SADV assays was 1 and it showed a strong correlation between quantitative results (r = 1.00, n = 15). Our uniplex and multiplex assays gave the same information about whether samples were positive or negative (k value = 1.00 (n = 8 per assay)) and displayed high correlations in the absolute quantification (i.e. C p values) of viral load (r = 0.82, 0.98 and 0.85 for grey squirrel assays and r = 0.98, 0.98 and 1.00 for red squirrel assays, with correlations displayed for tests of PGK, SQPV and ADV, respectively). When viral loads were calculated as RQ values, the correlation coefficients for comparison of uniplex and multiplex assays were r = 1.00 and 1.00 (n = 8) for grey squirrel SQPV and SADV assays and r = 0.85 and 1.00 (n = 8) for red squirrel SQPV and SADV assays, respectively.",
