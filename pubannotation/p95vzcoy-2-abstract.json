    "text": "The deformed wing virus (DWV) is a prevalent virus in honeybees with a broad host range spanning at least eight insect orders and three orders of Arachnida [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . This virus is a positive sense single-stranded RNA virus and a harmful honeybee pathogen [22] , of which at least three distinct genotypes or master variants-type A, B, and C-are known [21] . DWV can cause clinical symptoms such as crippled wings, a shortened abdomen, and a reduced host lifespan [22] [23] [24] . Driven by efficient vector transmission via ectoparasitic mites Varroa destructor, DWV has become ubiquitous [25] [26] [27] [28] .",
