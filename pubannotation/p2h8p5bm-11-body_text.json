    "text": "LIV is mainly distributed in the UK and Ireland, but it has also been detected in sheep in Norway and on the Bornholm island in Denmark ( Figure 1 ). LIV is most commonly known as pathogen of sheep and red grouse although humans can also get infected [17, 56] . Animals develop a febrile disease, which can progress to fatal encephalitis [57] . Like TBEV, the vector of LIV is the tick species Ixodes ricinus [57] . Ticks transmit the virus to animals, however, natural exposure to humans is rare [33] . Instead humans that are exposed to infected animals such as veterinarians, farmers, butchers, and abattoir workers, as well as laboratory scientists have acquired LIV infection [58] [59] [60] [61] . In between the years of 1934 and 1991, 31 human cases of LIV was described [62] . In humans, LIV causes a disease that closely resembles TBEV, with initial flu-like symptoms which can progress to severe neurological disease. Distinct but closely related viruses are also found in Spain (Spanish sheep encephalomyelitis virus), Turkey (Turkish sheep encephalitis virus), and Greece (Greek goat encephalitis virus) [33] .",
