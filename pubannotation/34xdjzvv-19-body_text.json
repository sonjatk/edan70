    "text": "In conclusion, we have researched the evidence to demonstrate the cross-protection efficacy of N3 in hSCARB2-transgenic mice which show greater susceptibility to natural strains B and C in orchestrating HFMD and CNS-like syndromes and may break through the limitation of current suckling model applications that can prolong the time frame of mice age for the diseases induction especially a unique HLS syndrome [11] . This model might serve as an experimental model for aiding the evaluation of anti-EV71 therapeutic medicine. The application of humanized monoclonal antibodies to control various viral infections was reported [39, 40] . Therefore, humanized N3 is expectable to serve as therapeutic agent to treat HFMD diseases in the future. It is also of interest to further evaluate whether CVA16 could elicit cross-neutralizing antibodies against different EV71 genotypes in this model.",
