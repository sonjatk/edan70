    "text": "family proteins: Viral infectivity factor (Vif) from HIV-1 binds to all Atg8-family proteins, and matrix protein 2 (M2) from influenza was shown to bind to LC3. Yet, influenza M2 protein is the only one that contains a LIR motif that has been experimentally validated. 52, 62 Other viral proteins listed in ViralZone as being related to inhibition of the autophagy process are the neurovirulence factor ICP34.5 and RNA-binding protein US11 from human herpesviruses, the protein Nef from HIV-1, and the protein TRS1 from human cytomegalovirus. 49, 61, 62, 67 Negative regulation of autophagy by ICP34.5 and TRS1 proteins depends on their ability to interact with BECN1/Beclin 1; 68-70 while US11 function has been linked to the protein kinase EIF2AK2/PKR. 71 Putative, or functional, LIR motifs could be identified for all these proteins using the iLIR web resource, except for the RNA-binding protein US11.",
