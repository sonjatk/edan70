The server code resides at the location of the SEED data. Users download a distribution with their choice of runtime environment that they may use to write programs to access SEED data or perform a number of common bioinformatics tasks using a supplied set of preprogrammed scripts. Currently, Perl and Java integrations are supported. The following subsections describe the four servers in more detail.",
