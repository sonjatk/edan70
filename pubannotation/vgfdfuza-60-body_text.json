    "text": "Therefore, the results of this paper highlight how difficult it can be to address AMR, especially when considering that Singapore has well-functioning stewardship programs, comprehensive hospital surveillance systems, and some of the latest technologies and innovations to address it. The example of AMR in Singapore brings to light the increasing need to address the social, economic, political, cultural, and behavioral aspects influencing AMR rather than just focusing on the technical solutions. Unless we understand how all these aspects operate and drive the response, it will be difficult to design appropriate policy interventions. In the next paragraphs we provide an example of each of these aspects to highlight their importance in the Singaporean setting. We address \"the social\" by analyzing how AMR has been socially constructed in Singapore; we discuss the influence of \"politics\" by considering power relations and governance approaches for the successful control of AMR; we address \"behavioral aspects\" by analyzing vested interests; and we consider \"cultural components\" by exploring how patients' cultural beliefs influence antibiotic consumption.",
