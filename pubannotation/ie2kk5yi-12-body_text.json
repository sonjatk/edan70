    "text": "Sequences were considered part of the same genotype if they had >96% identity in gltA, an established cut-off for Bartonella species identification [53] . Sequences with >99.7% similarity were considered the same genetic variant [54] . We used a Chi-squared test with the p value generated via a Monte Carlo procedure with 1000 simulations [55] to assess whether our defined Bartonella genotypes were associated with region (i.e., Belize, eastern Peruvian Amazon, western Peruvian Amazon).",
