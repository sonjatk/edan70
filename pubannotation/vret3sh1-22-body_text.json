    "text": "Currently this database consists of 16,279 compounds and 13,272 reactions. For compounds, the database also includes database IDs from KEGG compounds and SEED models, names/ synonyms, molecular masses, molecular formulas, molecular charge, and estimated Gibbs free energy of formation [27] . For reactions, the database includes database IDs from KEGG reactions and SEED models, names/synonyms, stoichiometry, EC numbers, pathways, and estimated Gibbs free energy change of reactions [27] . Compound charge, formula, formation energies and reaction stoichiometry are all calculated for aqueous conditions at neutral pH. All API functions used to access the Metabolic Modeling and FBA Server capabilities are documented in detail at http://servers.theseed.org/.",
