    "text": "A scFv is a recombinant antibody fragment, which commonly consists of a full variable region of an immunoglobulin heavy chain covalently linked to the corresponding variable region of an immunoglobulin light chain. scFvs have multiple benefits over traditional monoclonal antibodies due to their greatly reduced size, ease of genetic manipulation, and production of antibodies against viral proteins [14] . In 1994, scFv which binds to the Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) regulatory protein Rev was expressed intracellularly and potently inhibited HIV-1 replication in scFv immunized cells [15] . In addition, scFv against HIV integrase and reverse transcriptase showed reduced viral progeny in virus infected cells [16, 17] . The retroviral capsid protein can be used as an antiviral target and thereby extend the number of targets that can potentially be used in combined scFvbased gene therapy approaches [18] . However, despite the many virus resistant studies using scFv proteins, no reports are available about scFv having an antiviral effect against a broad spectrum of viruses. Montandon et al. (1982) showed antiviral effects against Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) with DNase I. In another study, DNase I digested DNA in the form of unmethylated proviral M-MuLV selectively [19] . Exonuclease, ISG20, which is induced by type 1 interferon (IFN), was over-expressed in CEL cells to inhibit HIV replication through nuclease activity [20, 21] . Another case was reported in a plant system using Pac1, an RNase isolated from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Challenging a transgenic potato that expresses Pac1 with potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) resulted in suppression of PSTVd infection and accumulation without significant undesired effects on the plant. The anti-viral effects of these RNases depend on their RNAhydrolyzing activity [22] .",
