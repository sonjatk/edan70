The HPLC analysis was carried out using Gilson HPLC System (USA) comprising of solvent delivery pump and ultraviolet (UV) detector connected to a Hitachi D-2500 Chromato-integrator (Tokyo, Japan) for data collection. An Eclipse Plus reversed-phase C-18 column (250 Ã— 4.6 i.d. mm, 5 m particle size; Agilent, USA) was used for separation. The mobile phase used was acetonitrile-1% aqueous ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.0 (15 : 85 v/v) at the flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The sample injection volume was 20 L and the wavelength of the detector was set at 325 nm.",
