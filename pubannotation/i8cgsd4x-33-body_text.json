    "text": "Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (25 mM Tri-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitor (Halt protease inhibitor cocktail, Pierce). The cell lysates were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Protein samples (10 μg) were loaded onto polyacrylamide gradient gels (4-12%). After electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, proteins were blotted using anti-Culex STAT (rabbit polyclonal against peptide VVIVHGNQEPQSWATITWDNAFADINRV PFHVPDKVSWNLLAEALNTKYRASTGRSM TQENMHFLC), anti-WNV NS1, anti-WNV NS5 [58] or anti-V5 (Invitrogen) antibody followed by anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies. After adding substrate, the membrane was exposed to film to detect protein levels. Anti-β-actin antibody (Abcam) was used in immunoblots as a loading control.",
