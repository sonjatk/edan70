    "text": "Gram staining of smear and bacterial BAL-culture were performed according to standard methods [14, 15] . 70 μL of BAL-fluid was centrifugated on a cytospin slide and Gram stained. Samples were considered representative of the lower airways, if >40 % of instilled volume was recovered and if < 1 % of nucleated cells are squamous epithelial cells on smear. Undiluted and 1 μL of a 1/1000 dilution of BAL-fluid were inoculated on blood agar supplemented with X and V factors incubated at 35°C in 5 % CO 2 , MacConkey agar and mannitol salt agar incubated at 35°C in air. Growth was assessed after 24 h, and after 48 h in case of no growth at 24 h. Results were reported in semi-quantitative terms, with a growth of potential pathogens of ≥10 4 cfu/ml considered significant.",
