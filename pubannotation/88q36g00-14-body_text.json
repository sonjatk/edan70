    "text": "Previous reports have demonstrated a causal relationship between prenatal exposure to LPS and deficits in social behavior and sensorimotor gating in offspring 38, [43] [44] [45] [46] . In this model, the social behavior including sociability and social novelty preference was impaired. The number of oligodendrocytes in the amygdala, cerebral cortex, and white matter in the offspring was decreased, which is consistent with previous findings 47 ; and a reduced number of neurons in the amygdala and cortex was also observed. Strong evidence suggests a crucial involvement of the amygdala in social processing and social cognition in humans [48] [49] [50] , as well as in social behavior in animals [51] [52] [53] . A recent report also suggested an association between the function of the cortex and the amygdala, and social behavior 54 . Therefore, the social behavior impairment observed in the present study is compatible with the neuronal and oligodendrocytic loss in the amygdala and cortex. A locomotor test was not performed in this study, although we observed no apparent differences in speed of movement among all groups in the three-chamber social test. Interestingly, there were no remarkable differences in the PPI test in our MIA model, and sensorimotor gating was also normal in comparison with the Control group. A possible explanation for these results is that PPI abnormalities might occur following exposure to a pathogen at mid-gestation 55 , while impairments in short-term memory and social behavior might be independent of the timing of exposure to a pathogen 2 . Thus, the negative results of the PPI test might be due to the fact that in the present model, LPS exposure occurs at late gestation, on embryonic day 17 (E17). Impairments in short-term memory and social behavior are well described in schizophrenia and ASD 38, 56 . PPI impairments manifest primarily in adults with ASD 57 , and are not observed in children with ASD 58 . A recent study further suggested that sensorimotor gating is only impaired in certain ASD subgroups 59 , although it may be a globally common feature in schizophrenia 60 . Therefore, the present model may reflect ASD-like rather than schizophrenia-like behavioral impairments.",
