    "text": "To demonstrate the effects of human movement on the deposition and removal of the aerosols of different size, Figure 4 gives the relationship between suspended fraction and aerosol size for case 1~3, respectively. Similar to Figure 3 , Figure 4 shows that the suspended fractions of all aerosol sizes decrease quickly. For case 1, at 30 s after the injections, the suspended fractions of all aerosol sizes are smaller than 10 −3 . For case 2, the suspended fractions of the aerosols smaller than 18 μm remain larger than 10 −3 until 43 s after the injections. For case 3, the suspended fractions of the aerosols smaller than 22 μm are still larger than 10 −3 even after 50 s after the injections. So the movement of the standing person can significantly lower the deposition and removal rates of all aerosol sizes. From Figure 4 (a)~(c), similarity can also be found between the characteristics of the deposition and removal rates of different aerosol sizes. The suspended fractions of larger aerosols decrease more quickly than that of smaller aerosols. These characteristics are not affected by human movement.",
