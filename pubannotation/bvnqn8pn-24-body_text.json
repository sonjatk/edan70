    "text": "Understanding the proportion of children with a preexisting diagnosis of asthma seeking advice in the ED for an exacerbation is important both for the individual patients and for the community, in terms of disease control and quality of life, and of healthcare costs, respectively. A history of acute asthma crises in the previous season or year was shown to be a risk factor for new exacerbations in 400 asthmatic patients aged 6-20 years [19] . Acute asthma exacerbations are largely preventable [2] , and so are ED visits and hospitalizations for this reason [9, [20] [21] [22] . In the United States, there have been federally funded initiatives to reduce this burden, such as school-based programs and a widespread dissemination of the guidelines, but a study performed on the total Pediatric ED visits from 2001 to 2010 highlighted that, despite these measures, the overall rate of potentially preventable ED visits for asthma did not change significantly over time [9] .",
