    "text": "We further hypothesized that mutant proteases may enhance proteolytic cleavage of a cellular target during viral infection to enhance virus replication. To this end, we treated Veros with 500 µM DFMO or left cells untreated and then infected at MOI 10 for 24 h. Cellular lysates were collected and analyzed for cleavage of eIF4G ( Figure 4C ). In untreated cells, we observed significant cleavage of eIF4G with wildtype infection that was not enhanced with infection of CVB3-2A 29K , -3C 52R , or double protease mutant. However, with DFMO treatment, eIF4G cleavage was significantly reduced in wildtype CVB3 infection, as previously observed ( Figure 4A ). When we analyzed DFMO-treated cells that were infected with protease mutant CVB3, we observed proteolytic cleavage of eIF4G, significantly higher than wildtype CVB3. In total, our data suggest that polyamine depletion significantly reduces CVB3 protease activity and that the mutant proteases derived from our passages exhibit a rescue in this sensitivity. controls with our luciferase reporter system into untreated and 500 µM DFMO-treated Veros. At 24 h, we measured luciferase activity and normalized to renilla luciferase activity and to control cells transfected with luciferase reporter alone (no protease). We observed that both 2A WT and 3C WT exhibited protease activity that was DFMO-sensitive ( Figure 5A,B) . Interestingly, we also observed that both 2A 29K and 3C 52R exhibited robust protease activity, even in DFMO-treated cells. We also observed that 3C 52R exhibited higher protease activity than 3C WT , though this was not observed for 2A.",
