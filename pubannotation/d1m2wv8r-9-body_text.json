    "text": "Based on a combination of three biological replicates from two mocks and five infected samples, the iTRAQ analysis identified a total of 3,224 proteins. Proteins were designated as differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) if they had expression fold-change ratios ≥ 1.2 or ≤ 0.833 and the p-value was less than 0.05. By two statistical methods, we identified 615 DEPs during the entire infection process by method 1 and 437 DEPs for all five time points by method 2 (Fig. 2c ). As shown in Fig. 2a1 ,a2, a total of 679 DEPs were identified by combining the two selection methods, which was greater than the number identified by each of the individual methods. Among the 679 DEPs, 373 proteins were identified by both methods.",
