    "text": "Since finding the MFE pseudoknotted secondary structure is NP-hard [30] [31] [32] , polynomial time MFE-based methods for prediction of pseudoknotted secondary structures predict a restricted class of pseudoknotted structures [33] [34] [35] . These methods trade off run-time complexity and the generality of the class of structures they can predict. For example, the most general algorithm of Rivas and Eddy [33] , whose running time is (n 6 ) on inputs of length n, is not practical for RNA sequences of length more than 100 nucleotides. This has been the main reason for development of heuristic methods for prediction of pseudoknotted structures [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] . Although heuristic methods may not find the MFE structure, they usually run faster than the MFE-based methods that handle the same class of structures. For example, HotKnots V2.0 [36, 41] is a heuristic approach that uses carefully trained energy parameters, is guided by energy minimization and can handle kissing hairpin structures. However, HotKnots is still slow on long sequences.",
