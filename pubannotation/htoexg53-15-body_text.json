    "text": "Spleens were harvested on day 8 post prime-boost vaccination. Splenocytes were prepared by passing through a 70 µm strainer (Falcon®, A Corning Brand, Corning, USA) and incubating with Red Blood Cell Lysis Buffer (SIGMA-ALDRICH, Taufkirchen, Germany). Cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium (SIGMA-ALDRICH) containing 10% heat inactivated FBS and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin. Splenocytes were further processed by using the QuadroMACS Kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) to separate CD8+ and CD4+ splenocytes with MACS Micro Beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany).",
