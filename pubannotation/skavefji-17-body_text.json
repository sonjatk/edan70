    "text": "The ability of BAL fluid cellular analysis to distinguish between bacterial pneumonia and viral pneumonia was assessed using ROC analysis (Table 3 last The sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values, negative predictive values, positive likelihood ratios, and negative likelihood ratios are summarized in Table 4 . When the cutoff value of BAL fluid total WBC count was $510/mL, which was selected using Youden's Index, sensitivity was 83.3% (95% CI; 67.9-93.2), specificity was 78.3% (95% CI; 62.2-88.6), positive predictive value was 68.2% (95% CI; 49.2-82.6), negative predictive value was 89.3% (95% CI; 77.0-95.5), positive likelihood ratio was 3.83 (95% CI; 1.80-8.17), and negative likelihood ratio was 0.21 (95% CI; 0.08-0.52). A combination of BAL fluid total WBC count $ 510/mL or serum procalcitonin concentration $0.71 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 95.8% (95% CI; 81.6-99.8) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.07 (95% CI; 0.003-0.40), whereas BAL fluid total WBC count $510/mL and serum C-reactive protein concentration $26.1 mg/dl had specificity of 95.7% (95% CI, 81.6-99.8) and a positive likelihood ratio of 8.63 (95% CI, 1.31-180.96).",
