    "text": "where m and n represent the number of subclasses in the exposed and infectious categories, respectively. The mean latent and infectious periods are represented by 1/r and 1/c, respectively, and are assumed to be known or estimated from independent data. This relationship was first determined by Anderson and Watson [36] and has recently been applied in the context of viral life cycle dynamics by Lloyd [33] . The relationship between estimated R 0 and the distributions of the latent and infectious periods is demonstrated in Figure 2A . It reveals a subtle yet very important interaction between model structure and estimated R 0 . In general, as the infectious period becomes more tightly distributed (increasing n), lower values of R 0 are estimated for any given growth rate k. On the other hand, as the variance in the latent period is reduced (increasing m), higher values of R 0 are estimated. Indeed, we may use the relationship given by equation 4 to arrive at the following general principle: if we ignore the latent period, then models with an exponentially distributed infectious period will always overestimate the infection's basic reproductive ratio. When the latent period is included, however, this finding is reversed when the growth rate is large ( Figure 2B ). In closely examining equation 4, we note that the basic reproductive ratio estimated from a model without an exposed class (1/r ¼ 0) is always lower than the estimate from the corresponding model when a latent period is included (1/ r . 0) (see equation S1 in Protocol S1). Therefore, when faced with a rapidly spreading infection, either entirely ignoring the latent period or assuming exponential distributions will lead to an underestimate of R 0 and therefore will underestimate the level of global control measures (such as mass vaccination) that will be needed to control the epidemic. The effects of changing the distributions of the latent and infectious periods on the estimated value of R 0 , with k assumed to be 100 per year and the average latent and infectious periods fixed at 1 wk. The gray grid surfaces show the asymptotic values of R 0 when the latent and infectious periods are both exponentially distributed (lower surface) or fixed (higher surface). We note that the shape of each surface is independent of the exact value of k. (B) At higher values of k, R 0 may be substantially over-or underestimated using the classical exponentially distributed model (n ¼ m ¼ 1) compared to periods of fixed lengths (n ¼ m!'), depending on whether an exposed class is included (solid lines) or not (dashed lines).
