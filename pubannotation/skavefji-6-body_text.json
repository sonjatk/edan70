    "text": "This study was based on data from a prospective observational cohort study conducted from March 2010 to May 2013. All patients admitted to the medical ICU of Asan Medical Center, a 2,700-bed tertiary care university-affiliated hospital in Seoul, Republic of Korea, with suspected severe pneumonia were prospectively identified and monitored until discharged [14] . The data collected included patient demographics, underlying diseases or conditions, illness severity scores including Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), type of pneumonia, laboratory data including microbiological tests, length of ICU stay, and outcome. The prospectively collected data were retrospectively analyzed. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center and the requirement for informed consent was waived because of the observational nature of the study. All patients information was anonymized and deidentified prior to analysis.",
