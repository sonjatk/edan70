    "text": "After we identified the direct 1918 human lineage viruses, we were able to adjust the dates of the later samples to account for a period of dormancy ( Figure 3 ). When we shifted the \"frozen\" samples back 21 years (i.e., sequences from 1976 were assigned a recalibrated date of 1955), we see the data lines up almost perfectly (r 2 = 0.989; mutation rate = 14.4). The exact amount of time-frame adjustment was not critical; adjustments ranging from 20 to 30 years all gave excellent alignments, with correlation coefficients above 98%. The observed accumulation rate of roughly 14 mutations per year (1.1 × 10 -3 mutations per site per year) is more or less consistent with previous estimates (e.g., [39, 57] ). The accumulation of non-synonymous mutations in human H1N1 genomes is also shown in Figure 3 . The non-synonymous mutations are not as abundant, as expected, but they are still accumulating at a rapid and constant rate. There were an average of 2.4 amino acid changes per year (0.6 × 10 -3 mutations per codon per year).",
