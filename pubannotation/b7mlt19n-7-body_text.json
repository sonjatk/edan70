    "text": "contain xLIR motifs whereas 15,460 contain WxxL motifs. 6247 proteins contain both xLIR and WxxL motifs whereas 129 proteins contain only xLIR motifs (without containing WxxL patterns) and 9213 proteins contain only WxxL motifs (without xLIR patterns) (Table S1 ). We found a correlation between the total number of putative LIR motifs identified in a family and number of sequences ( Fig. 2A) . On average, we found 8.3 LIR motifs per sequence. The fact that viral sequences often refer to polyproteins instead of individual proteins is possibly an explanation of the high proportion of patterns identified.",
