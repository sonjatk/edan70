    "text": "All experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. All data from western blot analysis, real-time PCR, and luciferase assays were expressed as mean ± SD. In cell viability assay, the bar graphs represented the mean ± s.d. of relative cell viability compared to the control group of at least three independent experiments. In western blot analysis, the optical densities (OD) of pPDK1, PDK1, EP4 and C-Jun were normalized to the OD of GAPDH in the same membrane. The data represented the mean ± s.d. of relative OD compared to the control group of at least three independent experiments with three samples in each. In transient transfection assay, the bar graphs represent the mean ± s.d. of relative luciferase activities compared to the control group of at least three independent experiments. One-way anova analyses followed by the Least Significant Difference (LSD) test were performed. Asterisks showed in the figures indicate significant differences of experimental groups in comparison with the corresponding control condition. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.",
