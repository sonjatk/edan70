    "text": "Using S min for each of the sampling methods, we find that SBS captures the main epidemic hotspots well, but slightly overestimates epidemic sizes in these hotspots. RMS also performs well, but slightly underestimates epidemic sizes. The TNS method proves an accurate predictor of epidemic sizes in all the most infected counties, with 8.7 and 13.7 farms being infected on average after 12 weeks in Cumbria and North Yorkshire respectively ( figure 3) .",
