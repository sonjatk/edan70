    "text": "More than 20 hantavirus species have been classified, and many more unclassified hantaviruses have been identified. They are hosted by several species of rodents (Rodentia), insectivores (Insectivora), and bats (Chiroptera) [4] . Little work has been conducted to understand hantavirus infections of insectivores or bats; however, much is known about the ecology of rodent-borne hantaviruses because of their impact on human health (Table 1) . A central problem of hantavirus/reservoir host research is the lack of reagents and methods for experimentally examining the immune response. Recent experimental work on the immunology of rodent reservoirs, summarized in an exceptional review by Easterbrook and Klein [5] , has begun to clarify these issues. The immune response is energetically expensive for wild animals, thus the findings of experimental studies will be critical for understanding the ecoimmunology of reservoir hosts of hantaviruses [6, 7] , and experiments using wild rodents in natural or semi-natural environments [8, 9] will be required to validate laboratory findings.",
