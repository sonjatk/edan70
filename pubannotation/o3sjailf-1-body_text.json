    "text": "Over the past decade, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become a useful tool to identify novel or emerging infectious agents. 1 Although NGS is not yet used as a routine diagnostic tool, it is increasingly used as a second line of investigation for select clinical cases, particularly when routine molecular and serological assays fail to identify a causative pathogen. We developed a NGS-based pipeline (ezVIR) to process NGS data for the identification of viruses in humans 2 with the aim of identifying divergent or unexpected viruses in biological specimens of subjects with unexplained clinical syndromes. 2, 3 We used ezVIR to analyze 30 nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected in a previous study that examined the causes of fever in Tanzanian children 4 who were suffering from respiratory symptoms of any type but for whom an infectious agent was not detected (except colonizing bacteria in the nasopharynx) despite extensive investigations, including viral, bacterial and parasitic molecular and serological assays. 4 The specimens were pooled in groups of five and assessed according to the specific RNA and DNA library preparation protocols as previously described 2 for NGS analysis (paired-end sequencing using the 100-bp protocol with indexing on a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Unexpectedly, an astrovirus VA1 was identified in pool 1 (Figure 1 ; Supplementary  Table S1 ).",
