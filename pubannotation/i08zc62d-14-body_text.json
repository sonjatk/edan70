    "text": "Comparison of the structures of sialidases from bacteria (Crennell et al., 1993 (Crennell et al., , 1994 Gaskell et al., 1995) , viruses (Varghese et al., 1983; Burmeister et al., 1993; Crennell et al., 2000) and humans (Chavas et al., 2005) suggested that sialidases share a highly conserved active site located within the six-bladed -propeller fold (Supplementary Table  S3 and Supplementary Fig. S5 ). To investigate the mode of binding of diplacone to the enzyme, we determined the structure of Cp-NanI in complex with diplacone. The structure of Cp-NanI CD in complex with diplacone shows little deviation from previously published structures. The -propeller fold within the apo structure (PDB entry 2vk5; Newstead et al., 2008) and the structure of Cp-NanI in complex with the substrate Neu5Ac (N-acetylneuraminic acid; PDB entry 2bf6; Newstead et al., 2008) show root-meansquare deviations (r.m.s.d.s) relative to our structure of 0.12 and 0.11 Ã… , respectively (Figs. 2a and 3a) . Consistent with our kinetic analysis, diplacone was bound to the enzyme active site. The principal interactions between the inhibitor and enzyme were hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. The 3 0 ,4 0 ,5,7 0 -hydroxyl-4-oxo group and the O atom at the 1-position of diplacone form direct or indirect hydrogen bonds with side chains of the tri-arginyl cluster (Arg266, Arg555 and Arg615) as well as residues Arg285, Asp328, Phe353, Tyr485, Gln493, Thr538, Tyr655 and the main chain of Ala292, in addition to three water molecules (W1, W2 and W3) ( Fig. 2b and Supplementary  Fig. S6 ). The flavanone backbone of diplacone also displays hydrophobic contacts with Ile327, Phe347, Phe460, Tyr485 and Tyr655, which orientate the inhibitor correctly and stabilize the bound conformation.",
