    "text": "Reports of anti-HIV-1 PNA delivery via CPPs come from Pandey's [91] [92] [93] [94] and Gait's [95] groups which have been working on antivirals targeting highly-conserved regulatory regions of the HIV-1 genome critical for its replication and gene expression, such as the primer-binding site, the A-loop and the transactivation response element (TAR). In their studies, the authors designed PNAs directed against these regions to inhibit HIV-1 gene expression and replication (Figure 1 ).",
