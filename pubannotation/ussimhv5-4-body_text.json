    "text": "Genetic recombination is generally considered to be a key mechanism underlying the generation and evolution of parvoviruses. Coinfection with multiple parvovirus strains has occurred, potentially facilitating recombination and leading to high genetic heterogeneity. 8 Recently, a Japanese research group provided clear evidence of recombination between CPV and FPLV under field conditions. 9 Interestingly, an analysis of the HN-ZZ1 sequence with the recombination detection programs RDP3 and GARD suggested that the HN-ZZ1 strain is a novel recombinant virus between CPV and FPLV. The RDP3 program identified nt position 2696 as an ending breakpoint, and a predicted recombination region was located around positions 1328 and 2696 of the alignment. Among the nucleotide sequence data for all 25 strains entered the RDP3 program, this part possessed the greatest similarity (99.3%) to the corresponding part of CPV-2b strain CPV-447 isolated from Germany (Supplementary Figure S4) . The GARD program identified nt position 2558 as a putative breakpoint for recombination. The alignment was cut at this point, and separate phylogenies for each section of HN-ZZ1 were constructed. The first half of the fragment aligned with the clade containing CPV, while the latter half of the fragment aligned with the clade containing FPLV. In addition to the HN-ZZ1 strain isolated in the tigers, there is strong evidence supporting recombination events in the genomic sequences of MEV_LN-10 previously isolated from mink, and XJ-1 and HRB-CS1 previously isolated from cats in China. [10] [11] [12] Phylogenetic analysis of the VP2 gene of the HN-ZZ1 strain and 21 reference strains showed that the VP2 gene of HN-ZZ1 aligned with the FPLV branch originating in Felidae and clustered in the FPLV branch. This study also indicated that the VP2 gene of HN-ZZ1 showed a relatively distant relationship from those of the Purevax and Felocell vaccine strains. We speculated that the differences in the VP2 genes between the wild type and vaccine strains may be one of the factors underlying the failure of vaccination against FPLV. 13 Interestingly, the nucleotide sequence of the NS1 gene was more closely related to the CPV branch originating in dogs and clustered with virus strains in the CPV branch ( Figure 1A) . We analyzed host-specific sites of key amino acids in the VP2 protein of the HN-ZZ1 strain and found that the amino acids at positions 80, 93, 103, 300, 305, 323, 564 and 568 of VP2 were identical to those of FPLV reference strains. However, the NS1 protein of the HN-ZZ1 strain had amino-acid characteristics of CPV, with the exception of the amino acid at position 248 ( Figure 1B) . 6 An analysis using other evolutionary models, such as the Jukes-Cantor method, produced trees with nearly identical topologies (data not shown).",
