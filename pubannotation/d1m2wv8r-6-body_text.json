    "text": "characteristic, a rodent parvovirus has been used in a phase Ι /Ι Ι a clinical trial to prevent tumour recurrence in patients with glioblastoma multiforma 5 . Currently, the clinical application of several chemotherapeutic agents is limited because of their severe toxic effects to healthy cells. Anti-cancer therapy using a virus that can selectively target cancer cells has become a popular approach. CPV is a virus that can be potentially used to treat cancer 13 . A previous study has shown that CPV2 NS1 can lead to regression of skin tumours in Wistar rats without producing toxic side effects on healthy cells 14 . Moreover, the CPV NS1 protein shows anti-tumour activity in a mouse mammary tumour model, and it further stimulates the immune cells to attack the tumour 15 .",
