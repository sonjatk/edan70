    "text": "The sensitivity of faecal antigen tests for the detection of parvoviruses is influenced by viral load in faeces, as well as by the presence of gut antibodies that can sequestrate viral particles and prevent binding to the test antibody [30] . CPV vaccine viral loads in recently vaccinated dogs are usually below the limit of detection of antigen tests, ranging from 1.48 × 10 0 to 2.5 × 10 4 copies/mg of faeces in one study [24] and from ≈10 0 to 7.50 × 10 5 copies/mg of faeces in another [31] . The lower limit of detection of faecal antigen tests for CPV in dogs is 10 5 to 10 6 viral DNA copies per mg of faeces [32] . Low titres of gut FPV antibodies in the New Zealand cats could explain the positive faecal antigen test results in those cats with low faecal viral loads.",
