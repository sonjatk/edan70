    "text": "In non-specialized epithelial cells as well as a subset of specialized immune cells that are susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, 16, 18, 27 type I IFN production is an important part of the host innate immune response and is initiated by ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic viral sensors in the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptor (RLR) family in response to the detection of viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). 28, 29 Stimulated RLRs mobilize downstream signal transducers that lead to the activation of the transcription factors IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) that drive IFN-β expression. 28 The transduction events within this signaling cascade are prone to negative regulation by many MERS-CoV proteins. In a comparative analysis of MERS-CoV structural and accessory proteins, it has been shown that M, ORF4a, ORF4b and ORF5 possess IFN-antagonizing properties. 22 We, and others, have characterized the ORF4a protein as a dsRNA-binding protein that interferes with the activation of RLR by either a dsRNA ligand or the protein co-activator PACT. 24, 25 However, the molecular mechanisms through which other MERS-CoV proteins manipulate the RLR signaling pathway to disrupt IFN-β expression have not been elucidated.",
