    "text": "Introduction Bats (Order: Chiroptera) serve as reservoir hosts for viruses of concern for human and animal health [1, 2] including SARS coronavirus, rabies virus, filoviruses, and henipaviruses [3] [4] [5] [6] . Bats can also harbor protozoa and bacteria of potential zoonotic relevance [7] [8] [9] . Bartonella spp. are of particular interest, as these Gram-negative bacteria cause bacteremia and endocarditis in both humans and livestock [10, 11] and exhibit high genetic diversity in bats across multiple continents and species [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Moreover, phylogenetic analyses show bats are reservoirs of zoonotic Candidatus B. mayotimonensis [18] [19] [20] , a causative agent of human endocarditis [21] .",
