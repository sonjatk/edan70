    "text": "Adenoviruses are ubiquitous, non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses [1] . Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) are classified into 7 species (Human mastadenovirus A to G) and at least 69 recognized genotypes based on serology, whole-genome sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses [1] . The prevalence of different HAdV types varies among different geographical regions [2] . HAdVs have been recognised as pathogens that cause a broad spectrum of diseases [1, 2] , including acute respiratory infection (ARI), gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, cystitis, and meningoencephalitis. ARI is prevalent in children, and is one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in the paediatric population in developing countries [3, 4] . Numerous outbreaks of ARI caused by HAdV have been reported during the last decade in many countries including China [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The HAdV types most commonly found in respiratory samples belong to HAdV-C (HAdV-1, -2, -5, -6) and HAdV-B (HAdV-3, -7) [2, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] ; however, severe or even fatal disease outbreaks are predominantly caused by only a few types (such as HAdV-14, -21 and -55) [2, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . The molecular typing by HAdV hexon sequences can help to accelerate the discrimination of types, resulting in timely epidemiological examinations and improved patient care [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Several studies have shown the association between severe respiratory infections in adult and HAdV species [7] [8] [9] ; however, reports among children with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in China are limited.",
