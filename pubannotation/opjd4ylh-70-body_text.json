We do not even get a danger allowance in case we contract infection in the wards. Instead we are being told that if we are found with TB we would be moved to another ward which is not a TB ward.\" Nurse (N1) further indicated that: \"we do not have TB awareness campaign, even just for a day, where the management just appreciates us for the great work that we are doing. At times I even consider other opportunities. Even the families of patients blame us for everything that goes wrong with the patients they do not appreciate the effort we put to care for the patients.\"",
