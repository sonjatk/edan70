    "text": "The CSFV NS5A functions as the modulation of viral RNA replication via interacting with NS5B and 3 1 -UTR [8] . In addition, the NS5A protein can inhibit the IRES-mediated translation through binding to the IRES located in the 5 1 -UTR. A previous study showed that the NS5A-interacting cellular proteins were screened using Y2H analysis, and the identified proteins are mostly related to gene transcription, protein degradation, protein folding and metabolism [26] . Recently, heat shock protein 70 has been identified to interact with the CSFV NS5A and enhance viral RNA replication [27] . In this study, eEF1A was identified as a novel NS5A partner and a negative regulator of CSFV replication. eEF1A had not been identified in the previous study, probably due to the different cell types (endothelial cells vs. primary macrophages) used to construct the cDNA library [26] . We showed that NS5A and eEF1A were colocalized in the cytoplasm. As NS5A is the component of the replication complex, whether eEF1A is also localized in the replication complex needs further investigation.",
