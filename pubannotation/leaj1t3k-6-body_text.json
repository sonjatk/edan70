    "text": "Current techniques for cellular delivery of antivirals include targeted liposomes in cell culture and in mice [11] [12] [13] [14] , receptor-mediated endocytosis through antibody binding in cell culture and in mice [15] , retroviral vectors in cell culture [16] , as well as adenoviruses in vaccine delivery [17] . However these techniques present certain limitations and concerns: low efficiency [11, 15] , immunogenicity [14, 15] , stability and rapid clearance in bloodstream [18] for liposomal reagents, and immunogenicity and viral integration on host gene expression for viral vectors [15, 19] .",
