    "text": "To investigate the ability of JEV released to the basolateral side of porcine NEC to infect MDM, the cells were incubated with 200 l of the basolateral medium collected at 72 hpi from JEV-infected NEC. As controls, MDM were challenged with JEV from our virus stocks at an MOI adapted to that of the basolateral NEC medium. To determine if epithelial alarmins influence JEV infection (Laos; MOI, 1 TCID 50 /cell) of MDM, recombinant human IL-25, IL-33, TSLP (Thermo Fisher), or any possible combination thereof was added at 10 ng/ml each, with the virus inoculum and removed at the same time after incubation. For MDM infection, the cells were incubated 1.5 h at 37°C and 5% CO 2 with the virus, washed three times with PBS Ϫ/Ϫ , and incubated at 39°C and 5% CO 2 for 24 h in fresh DMEM-2% FBS. The MDM were harvested as cell suspensions, immunolabeled with the anti-flavivirus group antigen antibody 4G2, and acquired on a FACSCantoII (Becton, Dickinson). Dead cells were excluded by electronic gating in forward/side scatter plots, followed by exclusion of doublets using Flowjo V.9.1 software (Treestar, Ashland, OR).",
