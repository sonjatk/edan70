    "text": "Nurses play a vital role in the hospital of caring for patients. They are the core members of the hospital who produce good and quality results. Therefore, it is important for the hospital CEO and nursing unit managers to support them in order for them to remain productive. The hospitals should make sure that they order quality equipment, and other materials to assist nurses to do their work effectively. Nurses should be provided with adequate and necessary training to empower them with relevant skills and knowledge. Good management empowers employees in the hospital in different ways and also listens to their requests. Below are the comments made by the participants: Nurse (N5) said: \"Hmmm, we believe that for now we just need special support from the management and all TB programme managers, to empower us with knowledge maybe by having workshops with us or arranging in-service training. It is crucial that we gain more knowledge on how to communicate with patients who are showing side effects or who are likely to default when they are at home. I believe that if we can be empowered with knowledge, the death rate and the spread of disease can be reduced.\"",
