    "text": "The route of transmission has important ramifications in terms of the host immune response where, presumably, a mucosal response occurs with aerosol transmission and a localized response at a bite site. Experimental data have also shown that patterns of the expression of genes related to the immune response are different in infected males and females [32] , and it is likely these differences have important roles in hantavirus ecology. Spillover to other rodent species also occurs [33] [34] [35] [36] , but it is unknown if the rodents remain infected. Recent work has shown that deer mice are experimentally susceptible to ANDV; however, virus is cleared several weeks after infection [37] . A pronounced Th2/Tfh gene expression profile occurs, including IL-4 pathway activation, that does not appear to be substantially activated in SNV-infected deer mice [13, 38] . This system provides an opportunity to identify viral and reservoir host factors that are important for sterilizing immunity that clears infection.",
