    "text": "In China, the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositive rate for the general population (between 1 and 59 years of age) is 7.18% (1) . Globally, there are ~93 million individuals with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections, 20 million of which are chronic (2) . Hepatitis B is the most common risk factor for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the mortality of HBV-induced acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) may exceed 60%. HBV infections are not easy to cure, and the mechanisms of the virus are unclear, particularly with regard to protein expression and regulation function in the pathogenic process.",
