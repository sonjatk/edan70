    "text": "According to the findings of the present study even though the support structure from the management is available, there is a need for special support for TB patients. Lack of support from the management confuses the nursing staff and causes staff to lose interest in their job. The findings of this study concur with those of the study by Manyisa and van Aswegen [28] , which revealed that South African hospitals' working environments lack resources and managerial support.",
