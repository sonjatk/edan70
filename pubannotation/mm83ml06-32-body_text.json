    "text": "The DIs P22077 and PR-619, which share the same cellular targets, namely USP7 and USP47, but not the USP7 specific DI P5091, exhibit antiretroviral activity indicating that USP47 alone or together with USP7 might play a major role in HIV-1 replication. It has been shown previously that USP47 is specific for the cleavage of K48-linked polyubiquitin chains and thus prevents the proteasomal degradation of substrates [88] . We could show that treatment with DIs targeting USP47 leads to an enhanced polyubiquitination and entry of Gag into the MHC-I pathway, indicating that USP47 somehow interacts with Gag and prevents its entry into the UPS.",
