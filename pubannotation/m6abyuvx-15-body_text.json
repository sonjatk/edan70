    "text": "However, in mice lacking either CD4 or CD8 T-cells, the pathological changes associated with chronic hepatitis were resolved following rVV-N25 immunization, and the steatosis score of rVV-N25-treated mice was significantly lower than that of control mice (Figures 4C-E) . These results indicated that CD4 and CD8 T cells were not responsible for the rVV-N25-induced amelioration of histological findings and that other inflammatory cell types may play an as-yet-unidentified role in the resolution of the pathological changes in these mice.",
