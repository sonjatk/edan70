    "text": "In order to further pinpoint which domains and codons in the macro-PARP genes have evolved under positive selection, we sequenced additional macro-PARP orthologs from a diverse panel of primates. Combining these with publically available sequences, we aligned and analyzed 15 or more orthologs for each macro-PARP gene (Table S1, Figure S4 ). Based on these expanded alignments, we confirmed the results of our initial screen; all macro-PARP genes have evolved under positive selection in Figure 1A . The region of the protein corresponding to human exon 30 is bracketed in red. Also shown below the schematic is an amino acid identity plot calculated using seven publicly available primate PARP4 sequences. (B) Results of maximum likelihood tests for positive selection from seven publically available PARP4 sequences using the entire gene, exon 30 alone or the entire gene except exon 30. Columns are as in Figure 1B Table S3 . doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004403.g002 simian primates (PAML p-value ,0.0001, PARRIS p-value , 0.01). In contrast to the recurrent positive selection on only a single exon of PARP4, we found that positively selected sites were broadly distributed throughout the macro-PARP genes ( Figure 3A ). For all three macro-PARPs, we observed strong evidence of positive selection acting on the macrodomains. However, removal of the macrodomain-containing segments did not result in a loss of positive selection signatures, indicating that both macrodomains as well as other domains have evolved under positive selection ( Figure 3B ). For instance, we found significant evidence for positive selection in the PARP domain of PARP14 ( Figure 3B ), similar to PARP13 [37] . In contrast, our analyses did not reveal evidence of positive selection acting on the PARP domains of PARP9 and PARP15 ( Figure 3B) , although it is possible that sequencing of additional orthologs might reveal more subtle signatures of selection. Thus, we conclude that macro-PARPs are evolving very rapidly, including substantial positive selection in the macrodomains of all three macro-PARPs.",
