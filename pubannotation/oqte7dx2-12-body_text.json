    "text": "Both WDR48 and WDR20 stimulate USP12 and USP46 catalytic activity (k cat ) without increasing substrate binding affinity (K m ; Faesen et al., 2011; Dharadhar et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016) , suggesting that the WDR proteins may affect DUB activity via a novel structural mechanism. Three recent studies provide crystal structures of the WDR proteins in complex with USP12 and USP46. USP12 and USP46 were each crystallized bound to WDR48/UAF1 (Yin et al., 2015; Dharadhar et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016) , and USP12 was also crystalized in a ternary complex with WDR48 and WDR20 (Li et al., 2016) . WDR48 and WDR20 bind the DUBs relatively far from the catalytic cleft and stimulate DUB catalytic activity via allosteric mechanisms (Figure 1 ; Yin et al., 2015; Dharadhar et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016) . USP12 and USP46 exhibit the conserved USP fold structure comprised of Fingers, Palm and Thumb subdomains, with the catalytic triad of cysteine, histidine and aspartic acid, nestled in between the Palm and Thumb FIGURE 1 | Model of USP46 bound to WDR48 and WDR20. This model is inferred from a combination of structures of USP46 bound to WDR48 and ubiquitin (Yin et al., 2015) and USP12 bound to WDR48 and WDR20 (Li et al., 2016) .
