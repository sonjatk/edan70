    "text": "Recombinant virus MVA-MERS-N was formed in CEF that were infected with MVA and transfected with the MVA vector plasmid pIIIH5red-MERS-N ( Figure 1a ). The MVA DNA sequences in pIIIH5red-MERS-N (flank-1, flank-2) targeted the insertion of the N gene sequences into the site of deletion III within the MVA genome. The clonal isolation was facilitated by co-production of the red fluorescent reporter protein mCherry allowing for the convenient detection of MVA-MERS-N infected cells during plaque purification. The repetitive DNA sequence of flank-1 (FR) served to remove the marker gene mCherry from the genome of the final recombinant virus through initiating an intragenomic homologous recombination (marker gene deletion). After PCR analysis confirmed the presence of more than 95% MVA-MERS-N recombinant viruses in the cultures, we selected the final marker-free recombinant viruses by plaque purification and screening for plaques without mCherry fluorescence. To confirm genetic integrity and proper insertion of the heterologous N gene sequences within the MVA-MERS-N genome, we analyzed viral genomic DNA by PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers specific for MVA sequences adjacent to the deletion III insertion site ( Figure 1b In addition, the comparative Western blot analysis of cell lysates from MVA-MERS-N or MVA-MERS-S infected CEF with antigen-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies suggested the production of comparable amounts of both MERS-CoV candidate antigens (Figure 2b ). This observation is in line with the fact that the MVA-MERS-S candidate vector vaccine expresses the MERS-CoV S gene sequences using the identical PmH5 promoter system [23] . As shown in previous studies, we detected two MERS-CoV S-specific protein bands upon infection with MVA-MERS-S indicating the authentic proteolytic cleavage of the full-length S glycoprotein (~210 kDa) into an N-terminal (~120 kDa S1 domain) and a C-terminal (~85 kDa S2 domain; not detected) subunit [23, 50, 51] . Following this, we used the total protein lysates from MVA-MERS-N or MVA-MERS-S infected CEF to assess the recognition of the MERS-CoV N and S antigens by sera from experimentally MERS-CoV infected animals. The Western blot analysis of sera from an infected rabbit (Figure 2c ) or a cynomolgus monkey (Figure 2d ) revealed the presence of antibodies specific for the MERS-CoV N protein. The recognition of the MERS-CoV N protein was at least as prominent as the MERS-CoV S antigen, which was suggestive of the induction of substantial N-specific antibody responses after experimental MERS-CoV infections.",
