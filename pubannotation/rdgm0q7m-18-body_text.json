    "text": "RNA binding by the PRRSV PRF trans-activators was investigated using EMSAs. A short (58 nt) 32 P-labelled transcript encompassing the minimal PRRSV frameshiftstimulatory region was incubated with nsp1␤, PCBP1 (or PCBP2) or both proteins, prior to electrophoresis on a 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Figure 4A , a single RNA-protein complex was observed, the formation of which required both nsp1␤ and PCBP1 (or PCBP2). Using a broader range of PCBP2 concentrations at saturating levels of nsp1␤, the estimated K d of the interaction was found to be 130 nM (Supplementary Figure S3) . In the presence of PCBP2, the PR mutant of nsp1␤ was able to bind the target RNA indistinguishably from the WT protein, but the RBM mutant gave a smeary pattern, indicative of weak, non-specific, RNA binding (Supplementary Figure S3) . As a control, a version of the RNA probe mutated in the C-rich region (CC2, Ref. 18) was also tested, and no nsp1␤/PCBP2 binding was evident (Supplementary Figure S3) . A supershift assay was carried out to confirm nsp1␤ and PCBP association with the RNA in the complex. The PRRSV RNA was incubated with nsp1␤ and PCBP2 and subsequently with specific antibodies targeting either protein prior to EMSA. As shown in Figure 4B , in lanes from reactions with an added anti-PCBP2 monoclonal antibody, an additional band of slower mobility was seen consistent with the presence of PCBP2 in the RNA/protein complex. A monoclonal antibody targeting the NTD of nsp1␤ did not yield a novel EMSA product, but a more slowly migrating species was observable with a polyclonal anti-nsp1␤ serum. These observations support the view that the RNA/protein complex seen contains both proteins.",
