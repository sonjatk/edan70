    "text": "In general, mutations in the consensus sequence could result either from selection for de novo mutations that occurred during host infection, or enrichment of sub-consensus variants that originated from the transmitting host. Since it is difficult to determine de novo mutations without complete sampling of an outbreak, we focused on those consensus mutations that 1) showed inversion between the historical and outbreak samples and 2) led to changes in the amino acids. Historical samples were defined as those collected between 1995 and 2000. Eleven loci were found to have such amino acid inversions, their frequency distributions for the historical and outbreak haplotypes are shown in Figure 5 A and B respectively. Although the frequencies of these two haplotypes sum up to 100% at a given loci in all samples (except for outlier entries colored white indicating no data and black indicating absence of these two haplotypes and presence of a third haplotype), the dominant haplotype tended to be near 100% (values below 100% have a median of 99.86%) and the minor variant had extremely low presence (median 0.15%, therefore could not be visualized if only one heatmap was presented). The outbreak haplotypes (shown in black letters at the bottom of the heatmaps) began as low frequency variants (0.04% to 6.03%) in the historical samples and rose sometime between 2003 and 2009 to become the dominant haplotypes (94%-100%) in most of the outbreak samples (Fig. 5B) ; while the historical haplotypes (shown in red letters in the heatmaps) went from being dominant (98%-100% presence) in the historical samples to low level variants (0.05%-1.95%) in most of the outbreak samples and even completely disappeared in seven of the outbreak samples (Fig. 5A) . These data highlight the dynamic evolution of the rabies genome over time.",
