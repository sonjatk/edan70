    "text": "As shown in Figure 2A , which pertains to pseudoknotted structures of the HK-PK data set, when provided with â‰ˆ 1% of the G big structure as input, Iterative HFold's bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval of average F-measures has higher accuracy than those of HFold. Iterative HFold continues to be significantly superior to HFold until approximately 90% of G big is available, after which HFold is more accurate. Iterative HFold is most successful when little information about G big is known because it can add both pseudoknot-free and pseudoknotted base pairs. In particular, using methods 3 and 4 (see Section 'Iterative HFold') Iterative HFold first finds a low energy pseudoknot-free structure that includes the given input structure (by extending the stems of the given structure), and then adds pseudoknotted base pairs to further lower the energy of the overall structure. However, when the vast majority of base pairs of G big are provided as input, HFold dominates as it keeps the base pairs of the input structure, thereby often adding base pairs of G small . When 100% of G big is provided as input, HFold's bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval is (85.74%, 91.87%), compared with (79.36%, 87.41%) for Iterative HFold.",
