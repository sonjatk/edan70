    "text": "To better understand which lung cells finally accomplish the pro-inflammatory gene expression profile observed 12 h after CNP exposure (Fig. 3b) , we divided the lung homogenates of sham and CNP exposed mice in three different cell populations: CD45-(negative) structural lung cells, CD45+ (positive) lung leukocytes, and by BAL recovered cells (here not differentiated in adherent macrophages and non-adherent leukocytes). Cell purification was confirmed by expression profiling for the cell specific markers Cd68 (macrosialin) for macrophages. CD45-(negative) structural lung cells were almost exclusively (>95 %) composed of alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells, which was confirmed by Aqp1 (aquaporin 1) transcript level as well as immunostaining for-proSFTPC (pro surfactant protein C), cytokeratin (both positive) and α-Sma (α-smooth muscle actin), CD31, CD45, T1α (negative) (Additional file 1: Figure S2 and S3).",
