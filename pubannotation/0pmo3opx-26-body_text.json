    "text": "Flow cytometry and microscopy. DU145 and PC3 cells were washed with PBS and harvested mechanically with a cell scraper. A total of 1 × 10 6 cells were incubated with 500 nmol/L cyc-LHSPW-(Gly) 4 -FITC or anti-CD13 antibody (22A5-FITC, Miltenyi) for 60 minutes at 4 °C. Stained samples and controls were assayed on a BD Facscalibur. Tumor sections frozen in OCT medium were sectioned at a thickness of 7 μm and briefly fixed in cold acetone for 10 min. After rinsing in PBS, the sections were stained with 250 nM cyc-LHSPW-(Gly) 4 -FITC overnight at 4 °C. The sections were washed with PBS and mounted with DAPI Prolong Gold. The slides were visualized using a Nikon 6D High Throughput Epifluorescence Microscope.",
