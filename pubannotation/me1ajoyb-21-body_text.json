    "text": "The Syrian golden hamster develops an HCPS-like disease when infected with ANDV or MAPV [22, 23] . Hamsters inoculated with ANDV mount an inflammatory response, as measured by elevated mRNA encoding pro-inflammatory mediators, prior to succumbing to the disease [55] . Infection also results in the activation of the adaptive immune response, characterized by antigen-specific proliferation of T cells and the generation of virus-specific antibodies [74, 86] . In contrast, SNV, which is highly pathogenic in humans, replicates in hamsters, but does not cause disease and is cleared by the immune response [87] . Passaging of SNV in hamsters results in a virus that is able to replicate efficiently and cause a persistent infection similar to what is seen in the rodent reservoir, yet still does not cause disease [88] . Examination of immune responses elicited by ANDV (pathogenic in hamsters) and SNV (non-pathogenic in hamsters) showed that passaged SNV evoked a stronger adaptive immune response than did ANDV; however, ANDV infection induced a much stronger innate immune response at late time points, despite both viruses replicating to similar levels. Depletion of T cells did not alter the outcome of infection [74, 86] ; thus, these data suggest that, at least in the hamster model, the activation of the T cell-mediated immune response is not responsible for immunopathogenesis, and perhaps the innate immune response, either elicited from infected endothelial cells, macrophages and/or neutrophils, might contribute to disease.",
