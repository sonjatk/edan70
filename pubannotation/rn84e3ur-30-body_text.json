    "text": "From Figure 2 (a)~(c), apparent and fierce fluctuation trend of the average position can be found for case 1 in all of the three directions when t > 30 s. Fluctuation can also be found for case 2 after t > 40 s, which is not as fierce as that of case 1. This fluctuation is because the number of the suspended aerosols is too small [22] . Hence Figure 2 also suggests that human movement may influence the number of the suspended aerosols as well as the deposition and removal of the aerosols. To demonstrate the effects of human movement on deposition and removal of the aerosols, Figure 3 shows the suspended fraction of all the aerosols for case 1~3. This suspended fraction is the ratio of the number of the aerosols remained airborne to the total number of injected aerosols. As shown in Figure 3 , the suspended fractions of case 1~3 keep decreasing. For higher moving speed, the suspended fraction decreases more slowly. For case 1, when t ≥ 27.2 s, the number of the aerosols remained airborne is less than 500 and the suspended fraction is less than 10 −3 . When t ≥ 39.6 s, the suspended fraction is less than 10 −4 . For case 2, the number of the aerosols remained airborne is larger than 500 until t = 37.2 s and the suspended fraction remains larger than 10 −4 even after 50 s after the injections. For case 3, there are still more than 900 aerosols remained airborne after 50 s after the injections, and the suspended fraction remains larger than 10 −3 . This result indicates that the turbulence effects, which are induced by the movement of the standing person, can significantly lower the deposition and removal rate of the aerosols and influence the fluctuation of the average positions of the suspended aerosols. In case 1~3, more than 99% of the aerosols are deposited in the cabin. So the movement of the standing person does not significantly change the total deposition fraction of the aerosols.",
