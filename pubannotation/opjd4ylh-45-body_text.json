She is the only specialist in the wards; the rest of us know TB a bit because we read about it and from the experience that we have as nurses, even though some of us have attended workshops but I do not recall having to go for training. TB patients undergo different stages and it is important for us to understand them. Hmm some of the behaviors that we see in the wards shock us and we do not understand why patients could behave like they are insane.\"",
