    "text": "Over time, a decrease of both the viral titers and the presence of the negative-sense strand was observed in the treatment colonies. It may well be that the treatment colonies would eventually reach a low viral level such as the controls, display low level replication and at that both A and B strains are present. However, we have no data to address those questions. What could explain the observed decrease of viral titers over time? Neither altruistic self-removal of infected nestmates [70] nor increased mortality in the treatment colonies were observed. Therefore, the higher initial viral titers and the more common minus-strand presence could reflect virus particles consumed with the infected honeybee food. In light of ant physiology [71] , this is nevertheless unlikely to explain the comparatively high viral titers and especially the presence of the minus strand for up to 13 weeks after the last virus-infected food has been consumed. The most parsimonious explanation therefore is that the ants were fed with highly virus saturated honeybee pupae resulting in initial viral peaks, then approaching lower equilibrium titers in infected ant individuals later. In light of these results, it appears as if controlled laboratory experiments are required before drawing general conclusions on the role of predators/scavengers as alternative hosts of any honeybee viruses, i.e., the timing of the last virus-infected food consumption should be known. Similarly, the detection of the negative-sense strand in V. destructor suggested DWV replication in the mites until recently, when a non-propagative manner DWV transmission has been proposed [72] .",
