    "text": "The user creates a workflow by selecting workflow components from a predefined list of deployed components on the cluster. Each component is configured to run on a particular cluster server or automatically assigned to a server if no explicit configuration is desired. At run-time Quascade performs a remote invocation to the selected servers and creates local instances of the used components. Hence, client-server communication takes place between a Quascade client and one or more instances of MP 2 servers forming the cluster. Complementary, server-server communication takes place between two or more servers or between a server and its compute nodes.",
