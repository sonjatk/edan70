    "text": "In view of this inter-region variability, it is not surprising that the global community of public health experts is itself conflicted about the use of quarantine and other restrictive measures that impinge upon the intrinsic rights of individuals. Those who favour the consideration of quarantine during infectious disease outbreaks maintain that it is prudent public health policy [23] , whereas those in opposition argue that quarantine is inherently paternalistic and an unnecessary breach of basic human rights [24] . Despite the difference of opinion, however, there does appear to be general agreement on this: \"ultimately, public health must rely not on force but on persuasion, and not on blind trust but on trust based on transparency, accountability, democracy, and human rights\" [24] .",
