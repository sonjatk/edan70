    "text": "The potential of CpG ODN as prophylactic standalone inducers of innate defense mechanisms has been the subject of only few studies. Most works in this field initially described protection of mice against bacterial [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] and parasitic [45] [46] [47] infections. More recently, induction of resistance to viral infections was shown also in mouse models for Herpes Simplex Virus [48] , neurotropic arenavirus [49] , foot and mouth disease virus [50] and Vaccinia virus [51] . With exception of the latter, all these studies were carried out with CpG-B. In an outbred species, partial antiviral protection has only been described in two studies so far, in which reduced shedding of herpes and parainfluenza viruses was observed in lambs after administration also of a CpG-B [52, 53] . To our knowledge, prophylactic antiviral potential of CpG-A has not yet been described in outbred animals.",
