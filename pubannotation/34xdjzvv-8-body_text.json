    "text": "The pathology of EV71-infected mice treated with N3 was examined by immunohistochemical and histological staining. Mice were given 200 mg N3 or isotype antibodies at 3 h post 1610 5 pfu of 5746 infection. The antibody-treated animals were sacrificed and tissue sections were prepared on Day 4 after infection. No marked lesions or inflammation were observed in the brain, spinal cord, skin, heart, spleen, lungs, or liver (data not shown) of infected mice received N3 treatment. In immunochemistry staining with anti-EV71 antibody, viral particles did not accumulated in the brainstem (Fig. 5A ) and muscles (Fig. 5B ) of mice treated with N3, in contrast to the marked accumulation in the these tissue of mice which did not receive treatment or received only isotype antibody. The muscle fibers were damaged in the non-treated mice and mice received isotype antibody but were not observed in the tissues from the mice received N3, compared to the section of normal muscle tissue (MOCK) (Fig. 5B ). Our previous study had showed that microvilli in the inner layer of the small intestine of transgenic mice would be completely destroyed after EV71 infection [11] . To investigate whether the EV71-induced pathogenesis in the intestine can be inhibited by N3 or not, histopathological stains of the intestine tissue on Day 8 post infection was performed. The result showed that the intestine from the mice received N3 was no damage, compared to massive destruction of the mucosa and microvilli in antibody-untreated or isotype antibody-treated mice (Fig. 5C ).",
