    "text": "A Top 20 data-dependent acquisition mode was selected in the mass spectrometer, with automatic switching between MS and MS/MS. Full-scan MS mode (350− 1800 m/z) was operated at a resolution of 70,000, with an automatic gain control target of 1 × 10 6 ions and a maximum ion transfer of 60 ms. The precursor ions were fragmented by high-energy collisional dissociation and subjected to MS/MS scans with the following parameters: resolution, 17,500; automatic gain control, 5 × 10 6 ions; maximum ion transfer, 70 ms; intensity threshold, 5,000; and normalised collision energy, 29%.",
