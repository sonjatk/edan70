    "text": "In vitro propagation is an important tool for rapid multiplication of medicinal plants [17, 18] as well as for the production of secondary metabolites. Tissue culture will ensure that the sources of the medicinal plants will not be exhausted or overexploited for their secondary metabolites. This is because the number of wild plants will not be effected due to overharvesting of the respective plants. Moreover the medicinal properties of a plant can be retained or increased via in vitro techniques. Previously, Yew et al. [18] have reported the effect of different cytokinins on in vitro shoot length and multiplication of H. littoralis. By adjusting phytohormones concentrations in the medium, differences in amount, rate, and growth patterns of explants were observed [19, 20] .",
