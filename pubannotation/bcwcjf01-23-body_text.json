    "text": "Some amino acid inversion sites were also associated with other parameters such as geographic location. Nonsense mutations generate defective RNAs that may or may not be functional. Stop codon mutations were shown to be maintained within the dengue virus populations, leading to altered viral fitness and thus influencing transmission dynamics [23] . Likewise, it has been shown that human respiratory syncytial virus mutants lacking the G gene are still able to form infectious particles in vitro [24] . Across all samples and genome locations sequenced by Illumina, 5146 variants were detected at 2302 genomic locations, or 22% of the 10451 positions sequenced. The frequency of these variants range from extremely rare (0.02% at Fx5 genome location 2130, high detection sensitivity due to high coverage of .196,0006, see Figure S1 ) to very common (38% at Fx 40 genome location 1021, measured at 32% by 454). The mean frequency of the variant pool is 0.3%, indicating that the bulk of the variants detected are ultra rare. To examine where in the genome mutations are most likely to occur, only those mutations that occur at .1% in a sample or occur in multiple samples with a cumulative frequency .1% are retained for further analysis. There are 248 loci with such high occurrence/frequency variants (''one-percent variants'', Figure  S9 ), their distribution across the coding and non-coding regions of the rabies genome ( Figure S10 ) are very similar to that of the 243 mutations occurring at the consensus level ( Figure S2 ). In fact, 58 of these one-percent variants occur at loci with consensus-level mutations.",
