    "text": "A PCR-based neutralization assay was adopted and performed according to Pittlot et al. [43] to evaluate the cross-neutralization Figure 7 . Administration of N3 reduced pro-inflammatory chemokines expression in CNS and muscle tissues of 5746-preinfected hSCARB2-transgenic mice. RNAs were extracted from the brain, spinal cord, and muscle of 5746-infected 7-day old hSCARB2-transgenic mice treated with N3 or isotype antibody, and antibody-untreated mice as described in Fig. 6 and were subjected to quantitative RT-PCR specific to (A) CXCL10, (B) CCL3, and (C) IL-6. The number of PCR cycles (Ct) required for fluorescent detection of target genes was calculated and presented as the relative expression after normalization with the internal control of b-actin expression from the same tissue. Each normalized 2 Ct value was the ratio to the value from the mean of 2 Ct obtained from the antibody-untreated tissues. A schematic representation of the target gene expression and the statistical average from 10 mice per group is shown. Unpaired student t test with Welch correction was used for statistical analysis. (*p, = 0.05, **p, = 0.01). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0069858.g007 of N3 against both genotypes B and C of EV71 viruses. Serial diluted N3 (10 mg/mL) were incubated with EV71 genotype B or C viruses (m.o.i. = 0.5) at 37uC for 1 h. The mixtures were then inoculated into a monolayer of the 3T3-SCARB2 cell line in a 6well plate at 37uC for 2 h. After absorption, the cells were washed 3 times in PBS and RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, CA, USA) following instructions provided by the manufacturer. Two sets of sense and antisense synthetic oligonucleotide primers were used for the detection of EV71 genotype B and C viruses. The primer sequences used to amplify genome expending from VP1 domain of the B4 and C2 virus were 59-AGAGAGTCACTTGCTTGGCAGACA-39 (B4_F), and 59-AC-GACTAGTGCCGGTCGGTTTAAT-39 (B4_R); 59-GCTAGT-GATATCCTACAGACAGGC-39 (C2_F), 59-GGACTGCTGTCCAAATTTCCCGAG-39 (C2_R), respectively. The PCR was performed with a total reaction volume of 50 ml containing 2 ml of cDNA, 16 the PCR buffer with 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0.2 mM (each) of deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 0.2 mM of each primer, and 2 U of FastStart Taq polymerase (Roche, IN, USA). Amplification was conducted according to the following cycling program: denaturation at 95uC for 4 min, annealing at 52uC (B4) or 57uC (C2) for 30 s and elongation at 72uC for 3 min for 40 cycles followed by a final extension at 72uC for 7 min, all of which were performed in a 96-well Veriti Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystem, MA, USA). The PCR products were then separated by electrophoresis in a 1.2% agarose gel containing SYBRH Safe DNA gel stain (Invitrogen, NY, USA) and visualized by ultraviolet light.",
