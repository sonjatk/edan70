    "text": "Considering these observations, the present study addressed the potential role of the nasal epithelium in contact transmission. Our hypothesis was based on the observation that after oronasal JEV challenge of immune pigs, it is possible to detect the challenge virus in oronasal swabs for several days in the absence of detectable viremia indicating local virus replication (9) . While JEV is also found in tonsils (8, 9, 12) , immune animals' tonsils were found to be protected from infection, indicating that this organ is infected only following viremia (9) and would therefore not represent the point of JEV entry. On the other hand, a recent study demonstrated the presence of viral RNA in the nasal epithelium as well as in the olfactory neuroepithelium (11) . We therefore investigated whether the nasal epithelium can be infected from the apical surface and whether this infection would cause both apical and basolateral virus shedding. This would indeed represent a prerequisite for the epithelium of the upper respiratory tract to play a role in direct transmission of JEV. The present work included ex vivo and in vitro experimental models as porcine nasal explants and well-differentiated porcine primary nasal epithelial cells (NEC) cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI). In fact, our data demonstrate that JEV has the ability of infecting apically, resulting in both apical and basolateral virus shedding in swine nasal epithelial cells and indicating that the porcine nasal mucosa could represent a gateway for JEV entry and exit in pigs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that epithelial cells release soluble factors favoring subsequent infections of macrophages known to be present in the lamina propria of the mucosa.",
