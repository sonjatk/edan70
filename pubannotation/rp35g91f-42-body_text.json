    "text": "The best candidate gene in the Chr2: 68.8 6 0.4 Mb interval was Nostrin which is expressed in endothelial cells, heart, and highly n Table 6 The pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network contains genes involved in ion transport that are associated with arrhythmia and dysregulated in atrial vascularized tissues including the lung (Zimmermann et al. 2002) , and has clear potential as a regulatory molecule. A primary function of NOSTRIN is to modulate the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by sequestering eNOS away from the plasma membrane (Zimmermann et al. 2002) . In turn, this prevents the calcium-mediated release of nitric oxide (NO) (Zimmermann et al. 2002) , a potent modifier of cardiac function, including regulation of contractility (Massion et al. 2003; Petroff et al. 2001) . Alternative splicing of Nostrin produces a truncated isoform (NOSTRIN-b) which is primarily localized to the nucleus (Wiesenthal et al. 2009 ) and represses transcription from its own promoter (Kim et al. 2005; Wiesenthal et al. 2009 ). Therefore NOSTRIN-b could also influence transcription of other genes within the pulmonary myocardium gene network. A model can be envisaged where NOSTRIN-b alters expression of RBM20 (the linkage peak for the Rbm20 eQTL contains Nostrin), leading to altered splicing of Nostrin (as well as other key myocyte genes), to provide feedback from stretch-induced NO release and result in altered contractile properties. Interestingly, RBM20 has been shown to directly influence alternative splicing of Zfp451 and Ttn (Guo et al. 2013) , both of which were identified as candidate upstream regulators in the other two eQTL peaks identified in this study. The eQTL interval located at Chr1: 33 6 1 Mb contained two possible candidates for regulating expression of the pulmonary myocardium gene network: Rab23 and Zfp451. Since a defined relationship exists between ZFP451 and cardiac function, we suggest that ZFP451 is the better candidate. ZFP451 has been shown to bind directly to SMAD3/4 which prevents recruitment of p300 to target promoters and results in the downregulation of transforming growth factor-b (TGFb) target genes in A549 lung epithelial cells (Feng et al. 2014) . This is relevant since transgenic mice expressing a constitutively active form of TGFb 1 were shown to develop atrial but not ventricular fibrosis and had increased susceptibility to atrial fibrillation (Nakajima et al. 2000; Verheule et al. 2004) . Upregulation of TGFb 1 is also known to induce myocardial hypertrophy (Parker et al. 1990 ) and is evident in animal models of heart failure (Dobaczewski et al. 2011 ). However, therapies which block TGFb would be expected to have adverse effects due to the pleiotropic nature of TGFb signaling (Dobaczewski et al. 2011) . In future studies, it will be important to determine if ZFP451 expression in the pulmonary myocardium and heart of atrial fibrillation patients is altered in parallel with increased TGFb expression; if so, this transcription factor might be a viable therapeutic target.",
