    "text": "Many computational methods for predicting the secondary structure of an RNA (or DNA) molecule are based on models of the free energy of loops [23, 25, 26, [33] [34] [35] [36] 48] . Table 1 summarizes the energy constants and functions used in our energy model for pseudoknotted structures. The values of these energy parameters are those of the DP09 parameter set of Andronescu et al. [36] , used by the HotKnots V2.0 prediction software.",
