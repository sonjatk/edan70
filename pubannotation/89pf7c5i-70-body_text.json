    "text": "It is noteworthy that three cats which were never treated with anti-Leishmania drugs after diagnosis died or were euthanized 1-5 years later and one was reported alive after 4 years. In these untreated cases, FeL progressed with time and chronic renal disease developed in two cats that were not treated. Untreated ocular FeL may cause vision loss and may require ocular enucleation due to panophthalmitis [50, 53, 55, 68, 69] .",
