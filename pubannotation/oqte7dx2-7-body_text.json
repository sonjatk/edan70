    "text": "Ionotropic GABA A receptors mediate the majority of fast inhibitory transmission in the brain. GABA A receptors are comprised of hetero-pentamers and ubiquitination of specific subunits can regulate receptor trafficking and degradation in an activity-dependent manner (Saliba et al., 2007; Jacob et al., 2008; Arancibia-CÃ¡rcamo et al., 2009) .",
