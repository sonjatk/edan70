    "text": "Although evidence from the field clearly indicates the ability of H9N2 viruses to induce pathology at the level of the oviduct [17] , only few studies have investigated the tropism of these agents for this organ, in a controlled experimental setting [18] [19] [20] [21] . Wang et al. proved in fact, that a H9N2 virus of the Y280 lineage isolated in the Shangxii province in 2011, could replicate at high titers in the oviduct, trigger apoptosis and cause a decrease in the number of laid eggs in the first week post infection and a reduction in egg-shell thickness [18, 20] .",
