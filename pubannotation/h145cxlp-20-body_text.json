    "text": "Five children (10.6 %), infected with A(H1N1)pdm09, died at an age of 4 to 11 years; four were male patients ( Table 6 ). Four of these children suffered both from severe neurological conditions (two children with previous peripartal asphyxia and spastic tetraparesis; one child with cerebral paresis and tetraspasticity; one child with congenital cerebral disorder), and from chronic pulmonary conditions; two of these four children were also born pre-term. Influenza-associated pneumonia was diagnosed in all four of these children; three additionally had secondary bacterial pneumonia, and one child also developed sepsis. For the fifth child, obesity was reported as the only risk factor; and sepsis and suspected encephalitis as complications. Bacterial co-pathogens were detected in three of these five children and suspected in one child; two viral and two fungal co-infections were also reported. All five children received intratracheal ventilation, antibiotics and catecholamines; two were additionally treated with antiviral medication. Death occurred 1, 2, 4, 19, and 26 days after PICU admission, with ARDS reported as cause of death in three children. Sequelae were reported for five patients (10.6 %): state after surgery due to pleural effusion/empyema in two children; increased oxygen requirements in two children who had previously already received oxygen therapy at home; damage of the lung after high-pressure ventilation in one child. Table 2 ). Figure 1 shows the difference in age distribution between both seasons, and the high proportion of children below 2 years of age as opposed to low proportions in all other age groups in season 3. After onset of symptoms, children were admitted to a PICU after a significantly shorter period, with a median of 3 days (IQR 1-4) in season 1 compared to 6 days (IQR 2.0-7.5) in season 3 ( Table 2 ). In season 1, significantly fewer children were diagnosed with bronchitis/bronchiolitis (Table 4 ), and they tended to require CPAP treatment less frequently than in season 3 (11.1 % vs. 41.7 %, p = 0.084, Table 5 ).",
