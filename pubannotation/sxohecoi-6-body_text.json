    "text": "Cervicovaginal secretions are maintained at acidic pH by acidproducing bacteria that make up part of the normal vaginal microbiota [25] . Although perturbations of normal microbiota, such as occur with bacterial vaginosis, raise the pH, the secretions generally remain in the acidic range [26, 27] . Semen rapidly neutralizes cervicovaginal secretions, but the extent of the pH change is variable. For example, a large amount of ejaculate may raise the pH to the neutral range, whereas a small amount may not [28, 29] . The pH of rectal secretions ranges from about 6.8 to 7.2 [30] .",
