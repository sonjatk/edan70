    "text": "Analysis of extracts of callus culture of H. littoralis revealed some interesting findings. Callus cultures supplemented with growth regulators at various combinations Comparing the amount of lycorine obtained from both wild plant and the callus tissue culture, it can be noticed that callus culture supplemented with appropriate concentrations and combination of growth regulators resulted in production of comparable amount of lycorine. This may be due to the effect of plant growth regulators (PGRs) such as the auxin and cytokinin used herein. PGRs are known to have effects not only on cell differentiation and proliferation but also on the biosynthesis pathway of the cell [22, 23] . Therefore, in this study, there may be a probability that the 2,4-D and BAP used in the callus culture could have partly been involved in the biosynthesis of lycorine. From the present study, the callus culture may be supplemented with only 4.50 M 2,4-D or a combination of 9.00 M 2,4-D with 4.5 M BAP to obtain a good yield of lycorine. This study can be further extended to investigate other combinations of PGRs that may increase the lycorine content of the callus culture. The findings of such study would prove to be useful as there are many benefits of the lycorine to the medical and health sector.",
