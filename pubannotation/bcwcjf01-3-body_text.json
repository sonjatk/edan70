    "text": "Different RABV variants are associated with different reservoir hosts and geographical locations. Typically, interspecies transmission of rabies virus from reservoir to non-reservoir host produces a single fatal spillover event; secondary transmission has rarely been observed [7] . For example, a bat variant may infect and cause disease in skunks, but it does not transmit efficiently within the skunk population and skunks would be considered a ''dead-end host'' for this variant. The exception to this would be the case of cross-species transmission (CST) where the variant from one species adapts to transmission by a new species [8] . For example, in 2001, bat variant rabies adapted to transmission within the skunk population in Flagstaff Arizona [9] , and in 2009 this variant adapted to transmission by foxes [7] . These events demonstrate the capacity of rabies virus for CST which may lead to increased exposure of humans to the pathogen and increase the geographical range of the virus.",
