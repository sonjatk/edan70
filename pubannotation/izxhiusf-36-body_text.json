    "text": "In our study, we found that bronchial bacterial infection is common in persistent preschool wheezers without apparent reasons for impaired mucociliary clearance, and that H .influenzae was the predominant aerobic pathogen isolated, followed by S. pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis. We also found frequent bacterial co-infection involving these 3 pathogens. Our findings corroborate observations of other authors, who also described the predominance of this bacterial triad in children with persistent or recurrent wheezing [9, 10, 19, 20, 23, 24] .",
