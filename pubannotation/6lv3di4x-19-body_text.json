    "text": "As part of the innate immune response against virus infections targeting the respiratory tract, such as influenza virus or RSV infection (28, 30, 32) , JEV infection of porcine NEC also induced several chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10), which would direct the migration of monocytes to the site of infection. This led us to investigate the potential next step for the establishment of a systemic infection, which could be the infection of myeloid cells present in the submucosal area. In fact, MDM were found to be susceptible to infection and supported a high level of virus replication which was further enhanced by IL-4 polarization. This is relevant, as such a polarization could also be induced following JEV infection of NEC through the release of alarmins, such as IL-33, IL-25, and TSLP, from stressed and dying epithelial cells (42) (43) (44) (45) . These alarmins are known to stimulate immune cells present in the nasal mucosa to produce IL-4 and IL-13, which promote M2-like macrophage polarization (62) (63) (64) (65) . In fact, our data indicate that supernatants from infected porcine NEC cultures contained factors which further enhanced infection of macrophages. We also demonstrated that these alarmins can enhance JEV infection of macrophages, further supporting this concept.",
