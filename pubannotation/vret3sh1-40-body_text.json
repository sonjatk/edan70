    "text": "The program starts by obtaining a list of all compounds and reactions in the SEED E. coli model (Seed83333.1) using the ''get_compound_id_list'' and ''get_reaction_id_list'' functions, respectively. The program then uses these lists to obtain detailed data on all the E. coli compounds and reactions (using the ''get_compound_-data'' and ''get_reaction_data'' functions, respectively). These data are stored in two tables: one for compounds and one for reactions. Next the ''classify_model_entities'' function is used to run a FVA on the SEED E. coli model. In this particular FVA, the reactions and compounds in the E. coli model are classified while simulating growth in LB media (called ArgonneLBMedia in the SEED model). At this point, the data returned by the ''classify_model_entities'' function is added onto the compound and reaction tables prepared previously. In the next step, the code uses the ''simulate_model_growth'' function to run a standard FBA on the SEED E. coli model, maximizing the model growth rate in simulated glucose minimal media (called Carbon-D-Glucose in the Model SEED). The data returned by this function are also added to the reaction and compound tables. In the final call to the server, the program uses the ''simulate_all_single_gene_knockout'' function to simulate the single knockout of all E. coli genes, and the results of this study are stored in a gene table. The remainder of the program handles the printing of the compound, reaction, and gene tables to the files CompoundTbl.txt, ReactionTbl.txt, and GeneTbl.txt, respectively.",
