    "text": "Examples of free radicals which is not associated with the real oxidative degradation (indirect method) are 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) or 2,2-diphenyl-1picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), both with different colour according to the redox status. Another example of indirect method is based on the reduction of Fe 3+ to Fe 2+ , in the presence of 2,4,6-trypyridyl-s-triazine. This method is known as FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power). There are also methods based on the chemiluminescence of luminal in the presence of free radicals, which can be produced through AAPH [29] .",
