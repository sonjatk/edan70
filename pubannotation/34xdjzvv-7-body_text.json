    "text": "To investigate whether the schedule of N3 treatment is ideal for protecting from EV71 infection in vivo, 7-day old hSCARB2transgenic mice were preinfected s.c. with a lethal dose of 1610 5 pfu of 5746 followed by a single dose injection of 200 mg N3 at 3, 24, or 48 h post EV71 infection, or followed by 2 doses of N3 injection (first shot at 48 h post infection followed by another 24 h later), or a low dose of N3 (70 mg) was given at 3 h post infection to examine the protection capacity. An isotype antibody was given at the same concentration (200 mg) as control in this study (Fig. 4) . It was found that the mice had a better survival rate correlating to a shorter time interval of N3 administration post EV71 infection; mice were fully protected when given one dose of ",
