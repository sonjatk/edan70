    "text": "The protein M2 from influenza A virus is necessary and sufficient for the inhibition of the autophagic degradation of the virus by blocking the fusion between the autophagosomes and lysosomes. 49 These results were further confirmed and extended by Beale and colleagues who show that the cytoplasmic tail of M2 interacts in a LIR-dependent manner with LC3 and promotes the relocalization of LC3 at the plasma membrane. 62 We have identified a WxxL motif at positions 89 to 94 that has the highest PSSM score (8 to 9), and corresponds to the one experimentally verified (FVSI). 27, 72 It is an F-type LIR motif and the fact that M2 protein has been shown to block the autophagosome-lysosome fusion suggests that it may act as a an adaptor protein.",
