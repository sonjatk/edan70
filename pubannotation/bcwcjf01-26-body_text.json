    "text": "All of the Humboldt samples had an unusual sequence, ETGL, as the final four amino acids at the carboxyl end of G protein. A recent study demonstrated that the last four amino acids in this region impact the virulence of the virus [27] ; if the final sequence is ETRL then the virus is attenuated due to induction of neuronal apoptosis. According to this study, virulent, wild type RABV haplotypes have QTRL as the terminal sequence, and do not cause apoptosis of the host cell. The impact of the ETGL haplotype on viral virulence is unclear, although it did not perceptibly impact virulence in skunks and foxes.",
