    "text": "AMR indicators, segregated mainly into process and outcome indicators, were set up in the public hospital surveillance system. Some of the process indicators were antimicrobial use for human and animal health, and infection prevention and control measures such as hand hygiene in hospitals. It was suggested that the Singapore government played a prime role in mandating the standardization, transparency, and sharing of data with the NAT. The motivation of the workforce was attributed to the competition, prestige, and reputation of the workforce. In the hospital setting, metrics and outcomes of antimicrobial stewardship such as average defined daily dose and percentage of appropriate antibiotics prescribed, and length of hospitalization for each department are often reported and shared among the various departments within the hospital. The transparency of data highly motivated the workforce to perform well in these benchmarking exercises. The following quote is an example of such occurrence: \"More important I think is the peer pressure and peer standing. And when it's made the department target and communicated by the head of the department, no one wants to be the worst department in the stats when they are shown up. So there's lot of department pride and that's what drives stuff. Doctors are often competitive, some of the nurses too. And no one wants to be the idiot that lets the team down.\" -I03, Human Health",
