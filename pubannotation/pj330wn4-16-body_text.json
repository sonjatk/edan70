    "text": "A total of 200 measurements were made for ciliary beat frequency, 100 for ependymal cilia and 100 for respiratory cilia. There was no significant difference (paired t test, P = 0.64) in the ciliary beat frequency obtained using the direct counting and ciliaFA methods (n = 200). The mean difference (± SD) was −0.05 ± 1.25 Hz and was highly correlated (r 2 = 0.991) (Figure 3 ).",
