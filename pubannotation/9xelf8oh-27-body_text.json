    "text": "Six red squirrels were submitted for post-mortem examination with gross skin lesions consistent with SQPV infection, and seven red squirrels were acquired with abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract that were compatible with a SADV infection. Of the three squirrels whose mortality was not thought related to SQPV or SADV infection, two had severe pediculosis and the other a severe pneumonia. As with the grey squirrels, swab samples effectively recovered both target and reference DNA in red squirrels, with only one arm swab failing to isolate squirrel DNA (n = 6 for each cutaneous swab site and n = 7 for rectal swabs) (see absolute quantification results in the Online Resource S10, Fig. S10.2) .",
