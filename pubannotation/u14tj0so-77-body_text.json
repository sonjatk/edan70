    "text": "Iterative HFold also has lower rate of accuracy deterioration than HFold with loss of information about the true pseudoknot-free structure, so it is more robust than HFold. This is particularly helpful when the given input structure may be unreliable and/or limited information about the true pseudoknot-free structure is available. Iterative HFold is also more accurate than ShapeKnots [47] on the test set of Hajdin et al. [47] .",
