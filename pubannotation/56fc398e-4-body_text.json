    "text": "In the UK, an annual livestock census records the location and species composition of all livestock farms. Births, deaths and movements of animals are recorded for individual cattle via the Cattle Tracing System (CTS), and for batches of other livestock via the Animal Movement Licence scheme. Such data have driven the development of sophisticated models to capture and predict the spread of livestock diseases such as FMD [1, 8, 17, 18] , bovine tuberculosis [12, 19] and Escherichia coli [20] . However, many countries around the world do not routinely collect farm-level data, or they are not readily available for research owing to issues regarding privacy. For example, in the USA, the National Agricultural Statistics Service carries out an agricultural census every 5 years. In order to preserve anonymity for farmers, all data are aggregated at the county level, and therefore precise locations of livestock farms are unknown. Furthermore, movement data are held at the individual state level, and there is no requirement for livestock movements to be recorded unless movements are out of state [21] . In the UK, the poultry industry infers movements between holdings using targeted sampling of premises based upon their function and size. This method predominantly targets large farms, and therefore does not accurately capture the demographic characteristics of the underlying farm population [22] . Therefore, it is important to understand the ability of models to predict the potential for disease spread through livestock movements when only a partial sample of the network is available.",
