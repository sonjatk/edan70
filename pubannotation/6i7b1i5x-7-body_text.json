    "text": "In a recent network and pathway analysis, responses were consistent with global activation of the immune response [54] . Although genome wide searches and similar techniques have not been definitive, genes involved with B cell activation, such as CD40 and the B lymphocyte kinase (BLK), have been identified [55, 56] . There is a growing body of literature implicating specific B cell responses in the pathogenesis [57] . In this review we will focus on the literature surrounding these recent reports of antibody reactive cellular inclusions and B cell involvement.",
