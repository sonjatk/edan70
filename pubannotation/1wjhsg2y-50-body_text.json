    "text": "Successful bat research networks rely on strong connections among members that are formed through trust, collaboration, and dialogue, and will weaken or cease to exist if any of these elements are missing [21] . Therefore, whether the aim of a network is to bolster relationships between already-connected members or foster new relationships with novel or unfamiliar actors, a network's structure and long-term sustainability are dependent on clear and consistent communication [21, 146] . Several ways to ensure such communication include: participating in scientific conferences, hosting regular workshops, and creating social media and other communication platforms that allow for direct dialogue and information sharing. Scientific conferences, whether domestic or international, act as centers of learning and networking. Individuals can discover new and exciting research paths, present on shared research, and identify new network members. Workshops bring together individuals from disparate fields and provide a space for networking, data sharing, and collaboration to effectively address research gaps within a network's scope. For example, Fair et al. [146] used a systems dynamic model to show that a single 2-week bat-borne surveillance workshop held in 2014 led to a massive interconnected network of scientific relationships and output, which included WAB-Net members. The WAB-Net currently organizes a collaborative workshop held in a different country in Western Asia each year, bringing together bat biologists, virologists, public health officials, and other relevant professionals. The first workshop was held in Tbilisi, Georgia, from 17-20 September 2018, and included 39 workshop participants from 14 countries, of which 21 participants were from 10 countries in Western Asia. Finally, websites and social media accounts can facilitate information sharing and discussion among research teams, and provide the public with information about the network, its members, and ongoing research plans [21, 151] . A dedicated WAB-Net website (www.wabnet.org) is in development to provide essential information to its members and the broader scientific community.",
