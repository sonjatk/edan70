    "text": "We also compared our original gene network, putative upstream regulators, and transcription factors from the extended gene network with the Deshmukh et al. data set and found three genes were upregulated (Myh7, 1.8-fold; Ttn, 1.8-fold; and Fhl2, fourfold) and five genes were downregulated (Rbm20, 0.6-fold; Tnnt2, 0.6-fold; Fndc5, 0.7-fold; Mybphl, 0.5-fold; and Tbx5, 0.7-fold) in the persistent atrial fibrillation cohort compared to either the susceptibility or the control cohorts (Deshmukh et al. 2015) .",
