    "text": "In contrast to CanL, exfoliative dermatitis (Fig. 5) is rare in the feline disease [36, 52, 68] . Other uncommon dermatologic presentations include hemorrhagic papules and nodules where Leishmania amastigotes can be found [37, 52] . Alopecia (Fig. 6) , which is also uncommon in FeL [12, 36, 52, 62, 64] , may be associated with other skin diseases concurring in L. infantum infected cats such as demodicosis [64] . Mild to severe pruritus is rare in FeL [58, 64, 65] and in some cases with a pruritic syndrome other compatible causes co-existed such as flea allergy [52] , pemphigus foliaceus (PF) [56] or neoplasia (squamous cell carcinoma) [14] . Skin histopathology of lesions associated with L. infantum has shown that the most commonly observed alteration is a granulomatous dermatitis [26, 51, 56, 59, 60, 68] .",
