    "text": "In-service training consists of hands-on opportunities for professional training and development to build specific scientific skill sets. One Health networks, in particular, often foster multidisciplinary research that relies on the transfer of knowledge and skills between its members and across disciplines for their success. In-service trainings, particularly through the sharing of best practices and standardized protocols and hands-on training, are meant to provide network members with an operational level of understanding on various subject matters, such that research activities can be replicated across both space and time. The WAB-Net currently consists of two programs designed to equip network members with a diverse set of skills. The first is \"in-field trainings,\" where local scientists are trained by expert bat disease ecologists on how to properly don and remove personal protective equipment (PPE); safely capture, handle, and identify local bat species; and obtain non-lethal diagnostic samples (e.g., saliva, feces, blood, urine) for virus detection. The second is a \"field-to-laboratory\" research exchange, designed to expose local scientists to every aspect of a multidisciplinary research project (ranging from field collection to laboratory methods to statistical and phylogenetic analyses). This is especially helpful in providing researchers of a given discipline (e.g., bat ecology, virology, epidemiology) with a more complete view of what a cross-disciplinary research project entails. Together, these trainings will promote collaboration and creativity, and provide participants with the skills and perspectives needed to better approach interdisciplinary One Health research.",
