    "text": "Although any cell can produce IFNa in response to infection, the acute systemic response to viruses has been attributed to production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC's, also known as interferon-producing cells or IPC) [23, 24, 25] , which comprise only a minor subpopulation of cells but can produce 1000 times as much IFNa as other cells [24] . Conventional DC's can also produce high amounts of IFNa if they are directly infected, but pDC's are uniquely able to secrete high levels of IFNa in response to endocytosed antigen. The role of pDC's in production of IFNa during LDV infection was investigated by depleting mice of pDC's the day before LDV infection using a pDC-specific depleting antibody [26] . The plasma IFNa response at 16 hours postinfection with LDV, as measured by ELISA, was abolished by pDC depletion ( Figure 3A ). Thus the systemic IFNa response was predominantly due to production by pDC's. In addition to loss of the IFNa response in pDC-depleted mice, we also observed the failure of splenic lymphocytes to upregulate CD69. A histogram showing CD69 expression on splenocytes from a representative mouse is shown in Figure 3B . Combined with the dependence on IFNafor upregulation of CD69 on B cells in vitro, the data indicate (B) Upregulation of CD69 on major splenic lymphocyte subsets at 16hpi with LDV was analyzed by co-staining with antibodies for CD69 and either CD4, CD8 or CD19 as indicated. The difference in percentage of CD69 hi cells between naïve and infected mice was statistically significant for all subsets by t test, P = 0.0225 for CD4 + T cells, 0.003 for CD8 + T cells, and 0.0018 for CD19 + B cells (n = 2 mice per naïve group and 3 mice per infected group.) (C) Tissue distribution of CD69 upregulation. Lymphocytes from spleen, blood, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and thymus were examined at 16hpi with LDV. All tissues except the thymus showed a significantly higher percentage of CD69 hi lymphocytes when infected with LDV infected (P,0.01 for all groups indicated by *). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0006105.g001 that in vivo upregulation of CD69 on lymphocytes is likely due to the systemic IFNa response to LDV infection. Interestingly, the loss of the IFNa response in pDC-depleted mice produced no statistically significant difference in LDV plasma levels as measured by real time PCR (15) ( Figure 3C ). Since IFNa can act in both autocrine and paracrine manners to limit virus replication and spread [27] , it appears that LDV is quite resistant to the antiviral effects of IFNa, even when present at very high systemic levels.",
