    "text": "Although not included in the current study, sTREM-1 in BAL fluid is another notable biomarker for the diagnosis of pneumonia. sTREM-1 is reportedly a potent discriminator of bacterial pneumonia from non-infectious lung infiltrations [12, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . However, the proposed cutoff values of sTREM-1 concentration vary widely (5-900 pg/ml) and some studies have questioned the reliability of BAL fluid sTREM-1 [28] [29] [30] . Studies on BAL fluid sTREM-1 have mainly been confined to patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia. Therefore, the usefulness of sTREM-1 for etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia, especially differential diagnosis of viral pneumonia, has not been elucidated yet. The current study directly compared patients with bacterial and viral pneumonia, and therefore differs from previous studies of sTREM-1. BAL fluid sTREM-1 concentration in combination with the BAL fluid cellular profile might exhibit better diagnostic performance, although this warrants further studies.",
