    "text": "Individual components in a workflow may be designated to run on different computing servers in a cluster by simply specifying a corresponding condition in Quascade. This provides a straightforward approach of constructing workflows that execute in a high-performance environment. In turn, a component running on a given server may use several computing nodes to execute its program, thereby providing a two-tiered mechanism of distributed processing. As an example, Figure 8 shows a physical workflow and its graphical counterpart. The workflow consists of a sample generator component, which generates/collects data, an analyzer component which performs the actual processing, and a sample sink component which 'consumes' the processed data in terms of not forwarding the data further to another component. While the genera-tor and sink components can be connected to external entities, i.e. physical devices, the analyzer component may be a simple single-node program or a complex, parallel multi-node application.
