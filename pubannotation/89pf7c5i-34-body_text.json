    "text": "Leishmania amastigotes have always been identified in the affected skin. A semiquantitative estimation of amastigotes was also performed with the aid of immunohistochemistry (IHC) [68] , in which the parasitic load of the skin ranged from high (>50 immunolabelled amastigotes/field at x400) to moderate (10-50 immunolabelled amastigotes/field) in cases of diffuse granulomatous dermatitis [68] . Conversely, it was low (1-9 immunolabelled amastigotes/field) in cases of granulomatous perifolliculitis or lichenoid interface dermatitis [68] .",
