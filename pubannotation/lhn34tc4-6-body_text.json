    "text": "Likewise, the SARS experience has sparked a renewed research interest in the ethics and effectiveness of quarantine. The findings of two recent retrospective studies of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic strongly suggest that it was non-pharmaceutical inventions such as quarantine and other social distancing measures that were most effective in slowing the rate of spread and minimizing the rate of death [8, 9] . And data from SARS-affected regions have pointed to the enduring value and effectiveness of quarantine and other restrictive measures [10, 11] . In contrast, there are those who argue that the use of quarantine during SARS was both ineffective and inefficient [6, 7] . The advent of advanced statistical modelling has added a new dimension to this long-running debate [12, 13] .",
