    "text": "In order to encourage a multidisciplinary, collaborative approach that integrates bat conservation and disease surveillance, WAB-Net aims to: conduct on-the-ground research to bring together regional experts from a variety of disciplines (e.g., bat ecologists, conservationists, virologists, public health officials); strengthen scientific capacity via research exchanges, data sharing platforms, in-region laboratory testing, and annual workshops; and promote the development and leadership of local scientists and officials. Taken together, these activities represent a coordinated strategy to advance scientific knowledge and capacity around transboundary zoonotic disease emergence and bat conservation in Western Asia. Additionally, WAB-Net has formed an initial Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) to help guide and oversee the network, comprised of a group of global experts with backgrounds in bat ecology and conservation, virology and laboratory diagnostics, and wildlife disease ecology. The SAB was formed to review proposed scientific activities, provide expertise during annual data sharing and capacity building workshops, monitor the network's growth and communication, and help liaise with regional and global stakeholders.",
