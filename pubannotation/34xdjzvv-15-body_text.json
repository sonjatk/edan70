    "text": "Passive transfer of protective antibodies has been shown to reduce the severity of viral infections, including Japanese encephalitis [26] , varicella [27] and coxsackievirus infection [28] . Previously, we generated 4 murine monoclonal antibodies that cross-neutralized subgenogroup B isolates of EV71 in vitro. Therefore, we tested the protective efficacy of the neutralizing monoclonal antibody N3 in a reliable model. Here we show that by using N3, hSCARB2-transgenic mice infected by either genotypes B or C of EV71 viruses were protected from developing HFMD-like and paralytic symptoms. We concluded that treatment of N3 (200 mg) at an early stage (3 h post infection) after infection afforded complete protection. A lower dose (70 mg) of N3 treatment at an early stage provided 90% protection. The protection efficacy dropped when N3 was provided at 24 h post infection, even though the multiple administrations of N3 did not rescue the mice from pathogenesis. This suggested that the protection conferred by N3 is in a dose and time-dependent manner.",
