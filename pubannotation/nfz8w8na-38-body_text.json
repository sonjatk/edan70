    "text": "Similar to the other epidemics, people living in poverty were most vulnerable to the effects of the Ebola epidemic. Poverty facilitated the spread of the Ebola virus; thus, interventions aimed at addressing poverty would be most effective in containing further transmission (Pellecchia et al. 2015) . Socioeconomic inequality was additionally evident in the Binequitable management of the dead^(Pellecchia, Crestani, Decroo, Van en Bergh, Al-Kourdi, 2015, p. 1) (Garbuglia 2016) . While cremation was a less acceptable cultural practice (Kobayashi et al. 2015) , it was mandated to limit further Ebola transmission (Garbuglia 2016) . The new practice seemed to have impacted the economically disadvantaged who could not afford to pay for private burial services instead of cremation, aggravating socioeconomic divides (Garbuglia 2016) .",
