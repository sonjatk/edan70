    "text": "The linear ranges of detection for the assays were determined using serial dilutions of the standards from 10 13 to 10 copies per reaction, and the limit of detection was established with twofold dilutions of standards from 100 to 1.0625 copies per reaction. Repeatability of the limit of detection was confirmed by making a further six triplicate reactions and further testing with the determined limit of detection with high levels (1.0 Ã— 10 7 copies per reaction) of the 'other' two assayed genes.",
