    "text": "Not always the best activity found in the TBARS assay also corresponds to the best ability to scavenge DPPH radicals. Such was found [44, 51] . The essential oils of Ageratum conyzoides or Amomum tsao ko presented better ability to prevent lipid peroxidation than for scavenging free radicals. Ageratum conyzoides methanolic extracts that had low capacity for preventing lipid oxidation, in the DPPH assay were revealed to be more effective than the essential oil [51] . On the other hand Lindera pulcherrima, Dodecadenia grandiflora and Dodecadenia gamblei presented the best inhibition of lipid peroxidation determined through the TBARS method as well as in the β-carotene bleaching test, but in the DPPH method, only Dodecadenia grandiflora was a powerful DPPH radical scavenger [44] . Another example was that reported [52] for Thymus vulgaris and Eugenia caryophyllus oils. In this assay, the authors found that the Thymus vulgaris oil had the best activity against lipid oxidation, whereas in the DPPH method, the authors found that Eugenia caryophyllus oil was the most potent scavenger of DPPH free radicals, even better than the standards ascorbic acid and BHT. The same authors also used the Rancimat test, and in that ase, the best oil was that of Origanum vulgare, although worse than that of the reference BHT. The non-polar fraction and essential oil of Hymenocrater longiflorus possessed great ability to inhibit the bleaching of β-carotene, nevertheless the results differed when the DPPH method was used. In this case, the essential oil was the only one that had the worst capacity for scavenging these free radicals [47] . Independent of the plant part of Myrtus communis var. italica L. used and the antioxidant method used, the methanolic fractions were always better antioxidants than the essential oils [46] . This is one example in which in both methods the results maintained in contrast to those reported until now.",
