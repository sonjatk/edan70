    "text": "The interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are a family of highly related proteins composed of 5 members in humans (IFITM1, −2, −3, −5 and −10) [1, 2] . Of these, IFITM1, −2 and −3 have emerged as broadacting restriction factors capable of interfering with the replication of a number of viruses including Filoviruses, Coronaviruses, Influenza virus, Dengue virus and the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . To stress the importance that IFITMs play in the control of viral infection, IFITM3 knockout mice display increased mortality and viral burden following influenza A virus challenge [8, 13] and a specific polymorphism in the IFITM3 allele has been associated to increased susceptibility to influenza virus infection in humans [13, 14] .",
