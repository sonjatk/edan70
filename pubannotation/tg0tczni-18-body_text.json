    "text": "The values of A, U, C, G and C+G were compared with the values of A 3 , C 3 , G 3 , U 3 , (G+C) 3 , respectively. An interesting and complex correlation was observed. In detail, the (C+G) 3 have highly significant correlations with A, U, C, G and C+G, respectively, indicating C+G may reflect interaction between mutation pressure and natural selection. However, the A have no correlation with A 3 , G 3 and C 3 , and U have no correlation with A 3 (Table 4 ). Both cases suggested that the nucleotide constraint possibly influence synonymous codon usage of polioviruses. In addition, the correlation between the Axis 1 (calculated by PCA) and the values of A, C, G, U, A 3 , C 3 , G 3 , U 3 , (G+C), (G+C) 3 of each strain was also analyzed. The significant correlation was found between nucleotide compositions and synonymous codon usage to some extent excluding Axis 1 and the value of A ( Table 4 ). The analysis revealed that most of the codon usage bias among ORFs of polioviruses strains was directly related to the base composition. Finally, the ENC-plot [ENC plotted against (G+C) 3 %] was used as a part of general strategy to investigate patterns of synonymous codon usage and all of the spots lie below the expected curve (Figure 1 ). These imply that the codon bias can be explained mainly by an uneven base composition, in other words, by mutation pressure rather than natural selection.
