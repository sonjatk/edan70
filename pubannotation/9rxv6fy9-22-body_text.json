    "text": "Irradiation chamber performance. The custom irradiation chamber simulated the transmission of aerosolized viruses produced via human coughing and breathing. The chamber operated at a relative humidity of 55% which resulted in a particle size distribution of 87% between 0.3 µm and 0.5 µm, 11% between 0.5 µm and 0.7 µm, and 2% > 0.7 µm. A comparison to published ranges of particle size distributions is shown in Table 1 . Aerosolized viruses were efficiently transmitted through the system as evidenced from the control (zero exposure) showing clear virus integration (Fig. 1, top left) . , (1) where k is the UV inactivation rate constant or susceptibility factor (cm 2 /mJ). The regression was performed with the intercept term set to zero, which represents the definition of 100% relative survival at zero UV dose. Bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for the parameter k were calculated using R 3.2.3 software 41 . The virus inactivation cross section, D 95 , which is the UV dose that inactivates 95% of the exposed virus, was calculated as D 95 = −ln[1 − 0.95]/k.",
