    "text": "The essential oils of different parts of Myrtus communis var. italica L. leaf, stem and flower were chemically evaluated. α-Pinene and 1,8-cineole dominated the leaf oil; 1,8-cineole, α-pinene, transcaryophyllene and linalool constituted the major components of the stem oil, whereas in the flower oil, along with these 4 components, there was also α-terpineol and eugenol. Leaf and flower oils had the best antixidant activities, nevertheless inferior to those of BHT and BHA. The authors [46] attributed such weak activities to the low level of phenolic compounds (eugenol in the flowers) or even their absence (stem and leaf), because the extracts also studied in the present work presented higher activities. Nevertheless it is worthy to refer the similar activities found in leaf and flower oils, in spite of the absence or phenols in leaf oils.",
