    "text": "Autophagy is a multistep process that consists of the isolation of cytoplasmic components into double-membrane vesicles, called autophagosomes, that shuttle to lysosomes, which serve as end-point degradative organelles. It is a catabolic mechanism that enables the removal of damaged or excess cellular organelles and proteins, thereby contributing to the maintenance of cell homeostasis and survival. 1 The autophagic machinery is highly conserved from unicellular eukaryotes to metazoans. Among the proteins that take part in this process, the Atg8-family proteins play a central role. 2 Indeed, these proteins are involved in the elongation and maturation of the autophagosome and its fusion with lysosomes. 1, 3 Phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated Atg8-family proteins reside on autophagosomal membranes where they can contribute to the recruitment of other core autophagy machinery proteins essential for the effective course of the autophagy process. 1, [4] [5] [6] [7] Although originally considered to be a nonselective bulk degradation mechanism, a gathering body of evidence over the past decade suggests that autophagy is much more selective than initially appreciated. Selective targeting of cellular components to autophagosomes for degradation relies on the existence of selective autophagy receptors able to recognize and tether cargos toward nascent autophagosomes. 8, 9 Examples of selective autophagy include aggrephagy, mitophagy, lipophagy, and xenophagy. [10] [11] [12] [13] The interaction between selective autophagy receptors and Atg8-family proteins is essential for the proper steering of the cargo for degradation. These receptors typically contain an LC3-interacting region (LIR, also known as LRS, AIM or GIM; the latter correspond to LC3 recognition sequence, Atg8-interacting motif and GABARAP interaction motif respectively) critical for the binding to Atg8-family proteins. 7, [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] The LIR motif consists of a short amino acid sequence with a core motif originally described as W/F/YxxI/L/ V (where 'x' represents any amino acids, and referred to as WxxL hereafter). 7, 18 This sequence has lately been relaxed and extended to 6 amino acids to integrate most of the experimentally verified LIRs. [ILV] , where the residues in positions 3 and 6 correspond to the most crucial ones for the interaction with Atg8-family proteins. [26] [27] [28] Besides its role in cellular homeostasis, autophagy is also involved in the innate immune response against pathogens. 13, 29, 30 Recent years have seen an outburst of studies on autophagy and viral infections. Autophagy may exert a variety of antiviral functions, including the degradation of viral components (known as virophagy), the activation of innate immunity by the delivery of viral nucleic acids to the Toll-like receptors, and adaptive immunity through the major histocompatibility complex II (MCH-II/HLA class II), or the control of the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] However, to be successful, viruses have evolved mechanisms to evade host defense. Several viruses have thus developed strategies to use the autophagy machinery or even thrive in the autophagosomes and promote their replication, spread, and survival. [44] [45] [46] [47] Other viruses susceptible to autophagy have evolved mechanisms to counteract autophagy activation by expressing proteins that interfere with the cellular machinery, essentially inhibiting the autophagosome-lysosome fusion or interfering with early stages of autophagy activation. [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] A few proteins from viruses infecting mammals and plants that interfere with the host autophagy process have been shown to associate with Atg8-family proteins. 52, [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] Yet, only one LIRdependent interaction has been reported. 62 We have developed a database, iLIR@viral (http://ilir.uk/ virus/), that organizes information on the presence of LIR motifs in viral proteins. Additionally, a curated text-mining analysis of the literature permitted us to predict functional LIR motifs in viral proteins that have already been shown to associate with Atg8-family members.",
