    "text": "To assess in detail the effects of rVV-HCV immunization on HCV protein clearance from the livers of CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/ 2) mice, we monitored the levels of HCV core protein in liver samples via ELISA. We found that within 28 days after immunization the HCV core protein levels were significantly lower in livers of rVV-N25-treated mice than in those of control mice ( Figure 3A ). Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that, within 28 days after immunization, levels of HCV core protein were substantially lower in the livers of CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice than in those of control mice ( Figure 3B ). Importantly, neither resolution of chronic hepatitis nor reduction in the HCV protein levels was observed in the mice treated with LC16m8, rVV-CN2, or rVV-CN5. These results indicated that HCV nonstructural proteins might be important for effects of therapeutic vaccines. In contrast, rVV-CN5 which encoded HCV structural and non-structural proteins did not show any significant effects. These results indicated that HCV structural proteins might have inhibited the therapeutic effects of the non-structural proteins. Therefore, it may be important to exclude the HCV structural proteins (aa 1-541) as antigenic proteins when developing therapeutic vaccines against chronic hepatitis C.",
