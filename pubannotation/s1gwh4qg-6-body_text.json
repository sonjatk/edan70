    "text": "By some considerations, the ID-to-name conversion for viral sequences is both of particular relevance and of considerable complexity. First, a large body of results in virus research can be linked to underlying sequences, owing to relatively small number of known viruses and comparatively small sizes of their extensively characterized genomes. Second, the virus naming, at the species level and below, is not governed by either the binomial Latin name convention traditional for cellular organisms or another broadly accepted nomenclature [13] that complicates communication in virology. For species, naming viruses is under auspices of the International Committee of Virus Taxonomy (ICTV) [14] . At the isolate and strain level, it is left up to individuals or groups of researchers to decide how to proceed [15, 16] . Researchers studying few economically most important viruses developed nomenclatures restricted for these viruses [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . In contrast, each decision about naming that concerns a majority of viruses is an ad hoc and, often, lengthy process. Likewise, naming viruses with artificially designed genomes, which are not product of natural evolution [23] , is formally outside of the ICTV authority and completely unregulated.",
