    "text": "For these experiments, we used two different strains of JEV, the Nakayama strain, originally isolated in 1935 (66) , and the more recent Laos strain (67) . Our results demonstrate a higher infectivity and level of replication for the Laos strain in both porcine NEC and macrophages. Associated with this was also a higher level of induced innate immune responses in epithelial cells. The reason for these strain-related differences is unknown, and strain and genotype effects require further investigations.",
