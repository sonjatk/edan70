    "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major public health problem; approximately 170 million people are infected with HCV worldwide [1] . HCV causes persistent infections that can lead to chronic liver diseases such as chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [2] . Antiviral drugs are not highly effective in individuals with a chronic infection; furthermore, an effective vaccine against HVC has not been developed. A convenient animal model of HCV infection will greatly facilitate the development of an effective HCV vaccine.",
