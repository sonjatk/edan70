    "text": "In this paper we use the HotKnots V2.0 DP09 [36] energy parameters in our implementation of Iterative HFold. To investigate the degree to which the energy model may be causing mis-predictions by HotKnots V2.0 or Iterative HFold, we considered the degree to which the maximum accuracy structures produced by these methods, i.e., the structure with highest F-measure, is better than the minimum free energy structures. Similarly, if we compare the maximum accuracy structure output by Iterative HFold with the minimum free energy structure, whether given HotKnots hotspots or the first 50 suboptimal structures to Iterative HFold as input, the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence intervals of average F-measure also show improvement -see Table 6 . The difference in improvements is significant in all but one case, namely Iterative HFold on hotspots structures as input for pseudoknotted structures of the HK-PK data set. We conclude that improvements on the energy parameter values for pseudoknotted structures may further improve accuracy of both HotKnots and Iterative HFold.",
