    "text": "Three hundred and twenty-four NPA aliquots were stored beyond 3 months at 2 to 8°C before analysis in Nepal. Of these, we re-analyzed the 133 that yielded a negative result, now using the aliquot that had been frozen at -70°C and transported on dry ice to Norway. This was done at the Department of Microbiology and Infection Control, University Hospital of North Norway, Tromsø, Norway, using the Hexaplex Plus assay and an automated extraction platform (NucliSens ® easyMAG, bioMérieux, Durham, NC, USA). Nucleic acids were extracted from 400 μl of sample, negative and positive processing controls and amplification control using the extraction principle with magnetic particles of this platform.",
