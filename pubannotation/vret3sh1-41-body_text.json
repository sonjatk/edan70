    "text": "The Gene Ontology (GO) project aims to unify biology by providing a controlled vocabulary of terms for all genes and gene products [40] , but has long had a focus on eukaryotes with less emphasis on prokaryotes and their viruses. On the other hand, the SEED database contains high quality annotations for hundreds of microbial and viral genomes, using subsystems-based controlled vocabulary. Mapping SEED functional roles to GO annotations for a given set of genes or gene products can be achieved via SEED servers. A workflow, detailed elsewhere (Short URL: http://bit.ly/server_paper_example8 ), uses two SEED serversbased programs to update SEED to GO comparisons through the use of UniProt [41, 42] protein identifiers.",
