    "text": "The essential oil of Ageratum conyzoides L., mainly constituted by precocene I and caryophyllene, possessed good capacity for preventing lipid peroxidation, using as lipid substrate liver homogenate [51] . The results were even better than those found for the reference BHA. The authors have also tested methanolic extracts of the same plants but the activities were about 100 times lower than those of the essential oils. The authors also hypothesise that the antiaflatoxigenic activity found for the essential oils may be partly due to their antioxidant activity [51] .",
