    "text": "In the present study, the authors aimed to describe changes in serum protein levels in patients with liver dysfunction induced by hepatitis B and patients with severe liver damage (ACLF). The purpose of this was to specifically identify one or more proteins that are able serve as biomarkers for predicting a pathogenic condition and for prognostic purposes, similar to Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It was not possible in this study to obtain a series of serum samples from individual patients as they progressed through the various stages of hepatitis B infection to severe liver damage (ACLF). However, using iTRAQ and western blotting, several candidate proteins were identified (namely apolipoprotein J precursor, platelet factor 4 precursor and VN) that warrant further study using a larger number of samples.",
