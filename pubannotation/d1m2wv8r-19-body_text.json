    "text": "As expected, a large amount of proteomic data was generated in this study. Venn diagramming functional annotation, hierarchical clustering, and pathway enrichment were utilised to analyse the results. A common analysis strategy in proteomics is to look for a period in which the changes in the protein expression were the most prominent. However, such a strategy is dissociated from the status of viral infection and the impact on the infected cells. A different strategy in this study was employed that combined the detected significant changes in DEPs with viral replication and CPEs. In view of the CPEs and the one-step growth curve shown in Fig. 1b , the viral titre was increased quickly during the first 12 hpi. In addition, the DEPs involved in the mitotic cell cycle were significantly enriched by up to 6.74% of the total DEPs at 12 hpi (Fig. 3 ). Since the cells had efficient proliferation at 12 hpi, this time point was suitable for studying the cellular proteins involved in autonomous parvovirus replication.",
