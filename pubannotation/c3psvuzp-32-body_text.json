    "text": "K-estimator [64] was used for all pairwise sequence analyses of dN/dS ratios. For comparisons of the large exon of vertebrate PARP4 (e.g. human and rhesus exon 30), we used K-estimator to distinguish high pairwise dN/dS values due to positive selection from the possibility that these sequences are neutrally evolving, but that stochastic fluctuations in small mutation numbers cause apparently large dN/dS ratio differences. For a pair of sequences with a certain number of observed mutations, K-estimator uses Monte Carlo simulations to obtain \"bootstrap\" estimates of how likely it would be to see high dN/dS values if sequences were neutrally evolving. For example, comparing human and rhesus PARP4 exon 30 (dN/dS ratio of 1.75), there is greater than 95% confidence that a dN/dS ratio of 1.75 represents a significant signature of positive selection. Sliding window analyses were performed on pairs of aligned vertebrate PARP4 and PARP14 sequences with a window size of 150 codons and a step size of 50 codons.",
