    "text": "Publically available genome assemblies from human (Homo sapiens), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), orangutan (Pongo abelii), whitecheeked gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys), rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), baboon (Papio anubis) and marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) were queried for PARP genes. The PARP12 gene is in a poorly assembled region of the orangutan genome and was therefore incomplete. The PARP15 gene is almost entirely deleted from the white-cheeked gibbon genome; exon 4 is still present but contains a stop codon. We therefore used PARP12 and PARP15 sequences from the publically available gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) genome assembly to ensure that seven primate sequences were used in all analyses.",
