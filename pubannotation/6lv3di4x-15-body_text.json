    "text": "that the presence of the alarmins during the viral infection phase can lead to a higher percentage of infected cells (Fig. 8A) . In nonpolarized macrophages, this enhancement of infection by JEV was statistically significant for IL-33 alone, for IL-33 combined with TSLP, and for IL-33 combined with TSLP and IL-25 (Fig. 9A) . In IL-4-polarized macrophages, a further enhancement of infection was statistically significant for IL-25 alone, TSLP alone, and every combination of IL-33 with the other alarmins (Fig. 9B ). ",
