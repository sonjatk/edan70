    "text": "Database searching and protein quantitation. All raw data files generated by mass spectrometry were analysed by Proteome Discoverer software 1.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using the Mascot search engine against the Felis catus protein sequences downloaded from the NCBI reference sequences (Refseq) database (downloaded on March 20, 2015, containing 35,247 entries). The parameters for database searching were as follows: trypsin was selected as the enzyme; up to two missed cleavages were allowed; the precursor and fragment ion mass tolerance were set to 15 ppm and 20 mmu, respectively; carbamidomethylation on cysteine was set as a fixed modification; oxidation on methionine and iTRAQ 8 plex labels at the N-termini and at lysine side chains were allowed as dynamic modifications. The strict maximum parsimony principle was applied, and only peptide spectrum matches with high or medium confidence were considered for protein grouping. Ion peaks were integrated based on the most confident centroid with a tolerance of 20 ppm.",
