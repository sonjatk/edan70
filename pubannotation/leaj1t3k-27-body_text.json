    "text": "Upadhyay et a l. demonstrated that PNA TAR -penetratin conjugate is moderately immunogenic mainly due to its penetratin moiety [100] . Cytokine secretion profiles of the lymph node cells showed elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2 and IL-12, which are known to promote proliferation of T lymphocytes and slow down the death of CD4+ T cells. The authors emphasize that these immunogenic properties of the conjugate could prove to be beneficial to the host.",
