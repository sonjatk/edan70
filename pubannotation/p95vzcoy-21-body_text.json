    "text": "Our results suggest that the ant M. rubra can be an alternative host for both DWV A and B as a result of foodborne transmission because of the presence of both high viral titers and the negative-sense RNA strand for up to 13 weeks after the last virus-infected food has been consumed. These results further support that DWV has a wide host range including other predatory insects [14, 15, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [29] [30] [31] [32] 37] . Interestingly, there were only two ant species from the family Formicidae among the more than 60 species in which DWV has been detected so far [21] . It is obvious that recently consumed highly virus infected food like honeybee pupae, containing the virus negative-sense strand, might lead to false positive results simply because of the presence of viral particles in ant's gut. Because of the delayed sampling, we can however expect that the gut content of the ants has been cleared out at least once before the virus analyses [55] .",
