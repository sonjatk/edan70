    "text": "Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) is a crucial transcription factor regulating multiple cellular pathways leading to survival or death of the cell depending on the stimulus. In unstimulated cells, the NF-κB dimers (p50/p65 heterodimer or p50/p50 homodimer) are retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form as a consequence of their association with members of another family of proteins called I kappa B (IκB). Upon stimulation by activators like tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 1 (IL-1), CD40L, lipopolysaccharides (LPS) etc., signaling cascades involving activation of various protein kinases are initiated that result in the recruitment and activation of the IκB kinases (IKKs) which phosphorylate IκBα, leading to its degradation by the 26S proteasome complex. The degradation of IκBα exposes the p50/p65 nuclear localization sequence and allows NF-κB dimers to translocate to the nucleus, bind to κB motifs in the promoters regions of many genes, and regulate their transcription [1] .",
