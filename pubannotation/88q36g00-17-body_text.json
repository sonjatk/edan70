    "text": "Several limitations of this study should be noted. In the current MIA model, additional core features of ASD, including restricted and repetitive behavioral patterns, were not investigated 73 . Thus, the effect of maternal H 2 administration on these symptoms remains unknown. The sensorimotor gating abnormality may be evaluated at an older age than was described in the present model, however, this might require changing other factors including the timing of exposure. Since the mouse brain is not considered to be fully mature until 3 weeks of age 74 , the interpretation of the results of behavioral tests in the present study requires considerable caution. In addition, we could not avoid the detrimental effects of maternal separation required for the measurement of body weight on offspring development. However, the separation was performed similarly for the offspring in all three groups, thus any effect should be minimal, and consistent across groups. In humans, it is currently thought that the occurrence of multiple risk factors, including genetic mutations and postnatal exposure to inflammation or other environmental triggers, may be required for the onset of ASD 1, 38 . Before advancing the clinical application of H 2 , it should be investigated whether H 2 could exert similar effects in so called 'multi-hit' models. Finally, in the previous and present studies, maternal H 2 administration was performed prior to the LPS exposure; thus, the therapeutic potential of H 2 remains unclear. Therefore, it might be relevant to evaluate the therapeutic effects of H 2 by administering H 2 to dams after exposure to LPS and in offspring.",
