    "text": "Nurses who care for dying patients are under pressure emotionally because of their beliefs and values about death as well as the emotions and reactions of the patients and their families. Despite TB being a curable disease, in almost all new cases, professionals such as psychologists, anthropologists, sociologists, and TB analysts have repeatedly indicated that talking about the disease still causes discomfort and unease in the population, especially within the poorer communities [26] . TB is surrounded by intense grief, with implications to different spheres of life, including social relationships. This is due to long-standing negative representations about this disease, which result in stigma and discrimination. Healthcare professionals believe besides TB's ability to impact patients' lives and causes death, it also has strong emotional impact on the life of a patient since it evokes disability, impotence, and self-discrimination.",
