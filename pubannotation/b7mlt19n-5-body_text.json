    "text": "The BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) menu offers the user to search the database using a protein sequence as query against the reviewed set of viral proteins from UniProt database. We have used Position-Specific Iterative (PSI) BLAST to search against the database. 65 This search can be run against any of the viral classification systems described above. By default, the BLAST search runs against all the data available in the database with a default e-value 0.01; nevertheless, the user has the possibility to run the BLAST search against a specific category (Baltimore classification) or Order taxonomic rank (ICTV classification), and define a different e-value. The results page displays the subject sequences from the database that match the query sequence. The LIR patterns are highlighted with red asterisks. The menus 'Bibliography' and 'Help' provide users with additional information. Finally, the 'Links' menu gives access to other iLIR web resources, inducing the iLIR search tool and the iLIR Database for eukaryote model organisms. 27, 28 Analysis of the content of the database",
