    "text": "Because sialidases are expressed not only in C. perfringens but also in human lysosomes (Neu1 and Neu4), cytosol (Neu2) and membranes (Neu3), diplacone could cause undesirable effects in humans because it may inhibit human sialidases. To predict how diplacone would interact with human silalidase counterparts, we modelled human sialidases (Neu1, Neu3 and Neu4) using the previously determined Neu2 structure and compared the specificity of diplacone with C. perfringens and human sialidases ( Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. S2 ). The Cp-NanI catalytic domain with bound diplacone was superimposed with the crystal structure of human Neu2 with bound 2-deoxy-2,3-dehydro-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and models of human Neu1, Neu3 and Neu4 that were constructed using Neu2 as a template. The geranyl group of diplacone is essential for inhibition of the bacterial enzyme as it occupies a hydrophobic pocket containing Phe353, Thr487 and Tyr587. In human Neu proteins the corresponding residues are polar and would not interact favourably with the geranyl group (Fig. 4b) .",
