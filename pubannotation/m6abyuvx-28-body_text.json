Notably, even with rVV-N25 immunization, the frequency of activated CD8 T cells was very low, and a minimum of 2-weeks incubation was required to distinguish the difference between rVV treatments. Even if a small population of specific CD8+ T cells played a relevant role in the reduction of core protein, it is difficult to assert that the only NS2specific CD8+ T cells were important to this reduction. However, based on the results presented in Figure 4B , we are able to conclude that at least CD8+ and/or CD4+ T cells were important to the reduction in HCV core protein. Therefore, to elucidate the mechanism of HCV protein clearance, further investigation of not only the other T cell epitopes but also other immunocompetent cells is required.",
