    "text": "We also investigated innate immune responses induced by JEV infection of porcine NEC, and our data indicate a mild and delayed induction of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 and undetectable levels of other cytokines, such as IL-1‚ê§ and TNF, contrasting with the inflammatory cytokine responses induced by common respiratory viruses (58) (59) (60) . As for IFN-s, which are important mucosal antiviral factors produced by respiratory epithelial cells, we did not detect a significant increase at the transcriptional level, confirming the relatively silent infection of the nasal epithelium, which could enable JEV to bypass the first line of immune defenses of the upper respiratory tract. This idea is also supported by the weak cytopathic effect of JEV on NEC and by the observed induction of SOCS1, a potent negative regulator of the IFN pathway and consequently also of the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (61) . This is in accordance with a report describing SOCS1 induction during JEV infection (36) .",
