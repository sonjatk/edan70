    "text": "To evaluate whether poly(I:C) injection caused hepatitis in CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (2/2) mice, we examined serum ALT levels and liver histology following poly(I:C) injection. We found that, following poly(I:C) injection, serum ALT levels in CN2-29 (+/2) / MxCre (2/2) mice increased, reached a peak one day after injection, declined from day 1 to day 6, and were not elevated thereafter; this time-course indicated that poly(I:C) injection alone did not induced continuous liver injury ( figure S6 ). Based on these findings, we believe that the effects of poly(I:C) injection in these mice did not confound our analysis of chronic hepatitis.",
