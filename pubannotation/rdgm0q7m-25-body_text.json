    "text": "The induction of PRF by the nsp1␤-PCBP complex has clear parallels with cis-acting structured RNA stimulators, including the capacity to induce a ribosomal pause and the necessity for maintaining a precise distance between slippery sequence and stimulatory element. In RNA structuredependent PRF, interaction of the stimulatory RNA with the ribosome impairs movement of the small subunit head during translocation, destabilizing the hybrid state and elevating energy barriers corresponding to subsequent substeps of translocation (15) (16) (17) . Completion of translocation is accelerated by slippage of tRNAs into the −1 frame, thus promoting PRF. At the PRRSV signal, the bound nsp1␤-PCBP complex would also be in close proximity to a ribosome actively decoding the slippery sequence, facilitating interactions between them. In this light, it may be significant that in pull down assays, nsp1␤ has been shown to interact with rpS14 (34), a protein immediately adjacent to a component (rpS3) of the putative ribosome-associated mRNA unwinding activity (13) and PCBP1 is known to interact with RACK1 (41), a ribosome-associated protein located close to the mRNA entry channel. Details of the molecular interactions that take place upon encounter of elongating ribosomes remain to be determined.",
