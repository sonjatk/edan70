    "text": "The essential oil of Cheistocalyx operculatus, which chemical composition was not determined, significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced secretion of IL-1β and TNF-α cytokines in RAW 264.7 cells, a mouse macrophage-like cell line [103] . However, and some years earlier, some authors had already reported that tea tree oil (Melaleuca alternifolia Cheel.), mainly its major component (terpinen-4-ol), was able to suppress the production in vitro of TNF-α and IL-1β, as well as IL-8, IL-10 and PGE 2 by LPS-activated human blood monocytes [106] . Six years later, Caldefie et al. (2006) [107] also reported the capacity of the essential oil of that species for suppressing IL-2 pro-inflammatory cytokine and stimulating the secretion of the anti-inflammatory IL-4 and IL-10 cytokines in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (monocytes and lymphocytes) stimulated by the lectin phytohemagglutinin (PHA) from Phaseolus vulgaris L.. Also using PHA from Phaseolus vulgaris for stimulating mononuclear cells, Hammer et al. (2000) [108] reported that the essential oils of Taxandria fragrans (J. R. Wheller & N. G. Marchant) J. R. Wheeler & N. G. Marchant, comb. nov., mainly constituted by 1,8-cineole, α-pinene and linalool, decreased the production of the cytokines TNF-α and IL-6.",
