    "text": "The used in vitro NEC model has the advantage of representing fully differentiated ALI cultures containing mucus-producing goblet cells and functional cilia, which both represent first physical barriers of infection. In contrast to in vivo work, such cultures permit controlled kinetics studies of virus infection and basolateral and apical shedding, which is not possible in vivo. The same applies to the macrophage work in terms of virus replication and shedding and analyzing the impact of epithelial-cell-derived immunomodulatory factors. Such models may be used for any species and therefore permit analysis of species differences.",
