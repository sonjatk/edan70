    "text": "In this paper it is demonstrated how such a system can be developed using a new distributed workflow design system called Quascade. As a proof of concept, results for an actual systematic phyloinformatics analysis of neuraminidase (NA) genes of H5N1 isolates and influenza viruses are presented. Various phylogenetic algorithms; i.e. UPGMA, Neighbor-Joining, Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Mr. Bayes [4] [5] [6] [7] , are compared with respect to their efficiency and accuracy in deriving biologically meaningful results. In particular, the presented study illustrates how these algorithms can be integrated in a unique user-friendly workflow in order to enhance the efficiency of a comparative phyloinformatic analysis.",
