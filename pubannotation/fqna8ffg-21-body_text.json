    "text": "This raises the question of which cells do actually get activated to drive the inflammatory response and generate the cytokine boost observed 12 h after CNP exposure. The most obvious candidate for the cell type which triggers the inflammation response to pulmonary particle deposition may be seen in the alveolar macrophage (AM). We have previously shown in rats, that already after a 6 h gold nanoparticle (14 nm) inhalation, particles were found in 94 % of the BAL AMs directly after the exposure period [29] . Accordingly also in the present study, carbon black laden AM were detected in the lungs already 3 h after CNP instillation, pointing to the highest cellular dose experienced by these tissue resident phagocytes. In view of the well-described potency, and necessity of AMs to respond to pathogens and to kick-off the local defenses against infection [50] [51] [52] , we hypothesized that the massive contact with particles would induce an inflammatory activation of these cells. In this context, Brown et al. [53] showed the activation of rat AMs in vitro, by increased intracellular calcium, AP-1 transcription factor activation and TNFÎ± production, all triggered by high doses of a very similar type of 14 nm CNP (Printex 90). So far however, no clear in vivo evidence was presented for the direct activation of AMs by pulmonary exposure to pure carbon particles.",
