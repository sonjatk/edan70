    "text": "Pneumonia is the leading cause of child mortality from infectious diseases, accounting for an estimated 1 million deaths annually, and mainly affecting children in developing countries [1, 2] . Mortality attributed to pneumonia has decreased since 2000, but remains a major public health concern [3, 4] . The main known causative pathogens reported are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [5] . However, their distribution varies by season and location. Data on the etiology and epidemiology of pneumonia in children in developing countries are still insufficient, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa [6] .",
