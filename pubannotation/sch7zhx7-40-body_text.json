    "text": "Beyond underscoring combination therapy, viral escape mutants are powerful tools for understanding how antivirals function during viral infection. By investigating how CVB3 escaped DFMO-mediated polyamine depletion, we observed novel mutations in viral proteases that led us to investigate how polyamines contribute to viral protease activity. Thus, these escape mutants have highlighted a novel function of polyamines during viral infection. As described above, these results have implications for antiviral therapy, but they also inform our understanding of basic mechanisms in virology. Additional mechanisms whereby polyamines function in virus infection may be observed using similar means to highlight how these relatively simple molecules contribute to infection in diverse ways. ",
