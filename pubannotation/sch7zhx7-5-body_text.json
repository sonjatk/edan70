    "text": "CVB3 (Nancy strain) was derived from the first passage of virus in Vero cells (NR-10385), which were obtained through BEI Resources, National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (NR-10385). For all infections, DFMO and diethylnorsmperidine (DENSpm) were maintained throughout infection as designated. Viral stocks were maintained at −80 • C. For infection, the virus was diluted in serum-free DMEM for a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 on Vero cells, unless otherwise indicated. The viral inoculum was overlain on cells for 10 to 30 min, and the cells were washed with PBS before replenishment of media. Supernatants were collected from CVB3 24 hpi and 48 hpi. Dilutions of cell supernatant were prepared in serum-free DMEM and used to inoculate confluent monolayer of Vero cells for 10 to 15 min at 37 • C. Cells were overlaid with 0.8% agarose in DMEM containing 2% NBCS. CVB3 samples incubated for 2 days at 37 • C. Following appropriate incubation, cells were fixed with 4% formalin and revealed with crystal violet solution (10% crystal violet; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Plaques were enumerated and used to back-calculate the number of plaque forming units (pfu) per milliliter of collected volume.",
