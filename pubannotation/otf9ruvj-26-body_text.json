    "text": "In several studies, hypogammaglobulinemia and overexpression of genes encoding immunoglobulin segments were identified in patients with septic shock [6, 16, 17] . Therefore, IVIG treatment could be a logical requirement in these patients. We included IVIG therapy in our ARDS patients based on these considerations, although we did not measure immunoglobulin levels before treatment. Indeed, in a recent retrospective analysis of 543 patients, high IgG levels were associated with high mortality in sepsis patients [18] . PCR analysis showed an early molecular response to IgM in the blood of patients with sepsis [19] . IgM levels remain low in non-surviving sepsis patients, whereas IgM levels increase transiently in surviving patients [20] . Single studies and metaanalyses have shown beneficial effects of IVIG therapy in patients with sepsis [21] [22] [23] . However, IVIG treatment remains controversial. Randomized studies have not shown any beneficial effect of this intervention in patients with sepsis or sepsis-associated conditions [8] . Therefore, IVIG therapy is not currently recommended in the latest sepsis guidelines [24] .",
