Some of them default because they go to traditional healers and the healers tell them that they have been bewitched; they are not really sick. When those patients come back to the hospital their condition will be bad and most of them do not survive a week. Some patients continue to smoke and drink alcohol and worsen their conditions as they fail to adhere to their treatment.\"",
