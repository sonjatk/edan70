    "text": "We explored the signature of adaptive evolution in exon 30 of PARP4 in more detail by sequencing exon 30 from genomic DNA from additional primates (Table S1 ). Analysis of a total of 15 primate PARP4 exon 30 sequences confirmed our initial screening results that this region has evolved under positive selection (PAML p-value ,0.0001, PARRIS p-value ,0.01) ( Figure S2A and Alignment S1). These analyses also identified several codons within exon 30 that display dramatic signatures of recurrent positive selection (Table S4) . For instance, despite being in close proximity in the primary sequence to codons that are strictly conserved across primates, codon 1517 has undergone at least six amino acid changes during approximately 45 million years of simian primate evolution, with a calculated dN/dS ratio .3 ( Figure 2C ).",
