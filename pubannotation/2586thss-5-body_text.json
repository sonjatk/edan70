    "text": "Construction and expression of recombinant HCV antigens. To obtain the HCV antigens, the sequences encoding the desired A novel double antibody sandwich-lateral flow immunoassay for the rapid and simple detection of hepatitis C virus regions in the HCV genome were amplified by RT-PCR, and cloned into the prokaryotic expression vectors, pQE30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), pET32a(+) (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), or pGEX-4T-2 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Chalfont St. Giles, UK), in-frame downstream of the 6-His-tag or glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tag coding sequence. Primers used for the HCV PCR amplification are listed in Table I and the structures of the plasmids are illustrated in Fig. 1 . E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harbouring the HCV gene fragment were grown at 37˚C in LB medium containing 50 µg/ml of ampicillin to OD 600 = 0.8. The expression of the antigens was induced by adding isopropylβ-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mmol/l. The cells were harvested 4-6 h later by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min and stored at -20˚C. Solubility analyses of expression products were performed as previously described (14) . Briefly, harvested bacteria were re-suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; containing 140 mmol/l NaCl, 2.7 mmol/l KCl, 10 mmol/l Na 2 HPO 4 , 1.8 mmol/l KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7.3), sonicated on an ice-bath, and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4˚C. After centrifugation, the soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed for the presence of expression products.",
