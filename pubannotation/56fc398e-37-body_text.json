    "text": "If only limited resources are available for data collection, it may be more efficient to record movements only from the most highly connected farms (the TNS method) or to use SBS (the SBS method). The TNS method proves significantly more effective than both the RMS and RNS methods when markets do not contribute to transmission-less than 20% of all farms would need to be surveyed in order to predict epidemic sizes to within 90% confidence in the UK for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria, Devon and Aberdeenshire. The model also gives a very good approximation of the spatial spread of the disease, the size of the epidemic peak and the epidemic duration. When markets contribute towards disease amplification, the TNS method requires that around 30% of all nodes would need to be surveyed in order to accurately predict epidemic sizes. The SBS method is found to perform less effectively than the TNS method, as this strategy rapidly identifies the most highly connected nodes that are likely to contribute most significantly to disease transmission. However, the SBS method may be more practical to implement as it does not require prior knowledge of the relative connectivity of the farms in the network.",
