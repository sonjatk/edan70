    "text": "The β-carotene bleaching method (coupled oxidation of β-carotene and linoleic acid) estimates the relative ability of antioxidant compounds in plant extracts to scavenge the radical of linoleic acid peroxide that oxidizes β-carotene in the emulsion phase. β-carotene in the absence of the antixodant undergoes a rapid decolourization since the free linoleic acid radical attacks the β-carotene, which loses the double bonds and, consequently, its orange colour.",
