    "text": "The antioxidant activity of essential oils has been target of investigation due to their potential as preservatives, cosmeceuticals or nutraceuticals in the food and cosmetic industries. The search for antiinflammatory activities in essential oils has also increased during these last years. This work reports the antioxidant activities of essential oils which may act by preventing lipid peroxidation, scavenging free radicals or, and in very few cases, chelating metal ions. Some works also showed that the constituents of essential oil act synergistically because their main components when used as references have less activity than the essential oil. Therefore, synergism and antagonism studies must be developed.",
