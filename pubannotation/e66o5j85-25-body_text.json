    "text": "During hospital stay, pneumonia cases received the following antibiotics: Amoxicillin (n = 111, 94.1%), Ceftriaxone (n = 3, 2.6%), Amoxicillin/Clavulanic acid (n = 3, 2.5%), Ciprofloxacin (n = 1, 0.8%), and Vancomycin (n = 2, 1.6%). Fifty-one (43.2%) received oxygen for a median length of 2 days (IQR: 1-3 days), and 3 (2.5%) had blood transfusions. Three patients with pleural effusions were tested for microbial detection. Five patients died (lethality: 4.2%); death was directly related to pneumonia in 4 patients ( Table 2 ). Table 1 compares the clinical signs and symptoms at admission between cases and controls, underlying conditions and biological findings. Pneumonia cases differed from controls regarding clinical signs and symptoms as well as vital signs at admission, but not in terms of demographic factors or past medical history. Pneumonia cases were more frequently hypoxemic (defined as oxygen saturation<90%) at admission than the controls (30.5% vs. 0%, P<0.001). PCV coverage was zero in both groups.",
