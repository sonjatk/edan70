For the present work, we employed the same JEV strains as in our previously published in vivo studies (8, 9, 12) : JEV Laos, belonging to genotype 1 (CNS769_Laos_2009; GenBank accession number KC196115.1 [67] ; kindly provided by R. Charrel, Aix-Marseille Université, France), and JEV Nakayama, genotype 3 (National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses, Salisbury, UK). JEV was propagated in Vero cells (ATCC CCL81) in G-MEM BHK-21 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biowest, Nuaillé, France) and cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Viral titers were determined in Vero cells using the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) with the anti-flavivirus E antibody 4G2 (ATCC HB-112). Titers were calculated and expressed as 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) per milliliter.",
