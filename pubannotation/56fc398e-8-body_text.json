    "text": "We compare four imperfect data types: random sampling of movements (weighted edges), random sampling of farms (nodes), SBS [30, 36] of farms and targeted sampling of farms. If appropriate, we then scale the sampled networks up, so that the original number of movements is used for the epidemic simulations. In the UK, selling and buying of livestock often takes place through livestock markets. Previous work suggests that these markets played a substantial role during the 2001 FMD outbreak [10] . As animals from different farms are kept in close proximity, there is a risk of disease transmission between batches of animals resulting in spread of infection to multiple farms. Moreover, it is known that movements from markets cover a large geographical area [37] . Therefore, we investigate the potential role of markets in disease transmission between farms.",
