    "text": "Far-UVC dosimetry. Optical power measurements were performed using an 818-UV/DB low-power UV enhanced silicon photodetector with an 843-R optical power meter (Newport, Irvine, CA). Additional dosimetry to determine the uniformity of the UV exposure was performed using far-UVC sensitive film as described in our previous work 28, 29 . This film has a high spatial resolution with the ability to resolve features to at least 25 Âµm, and exhibits a nearly ideal cosine response 30, 31 . Measurements were taken between experiments therefore allowing placement of sensors inside the chamber.",
