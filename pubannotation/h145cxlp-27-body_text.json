    "text": "The incidence estimates of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09associated PICU admissions, derived from active screening of PICU patients with acute respiratory infections, reached similarly high levels in the first and third postpandemic seasons. Both incidence estimates were higher than those previously reported by nation-wide PICU surveillance for the pandemic and the first post-pandemic season, suggesting possible underreporting in previous studies without active screening. Comparison of the first and third post-pandemic seasons indicated an age shift of severe A(H1N1)pdm09 towards younger children, which might be explained by increasing immunity in the older paediatric population. The large proportion of children with underlying chronic conditions indicates the need for a more consistent implementation of the current recommendations for influenza vaccination of specific risk groups in Germany. These children could also profit from herd protection, if universal influenza vaccination was successfully introduced in Germany. Authors' contributions AS designed the study, coordinated data collection, performed the analysis, interpreted the data, and drafted the manuscript. BW and CP performed multiplex PCR and subtyping on laboratory specimens, interpreted virological data, and revised the manuscript. JGL supervised the study, supported data interpretation, and revised the manuscript. The clinical data were collected by the Bavarian PICU Study Group on Influenza and Other Viral ARI, from Oct 2010 to September 2013. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.",
