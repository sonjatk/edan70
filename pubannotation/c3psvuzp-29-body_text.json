    "text": "Sequencing of primate PARP genes PARP4 exon 30 sequences were amplified from DNA isolated from cell lines obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ), the FrozenZoo (San Diego, CA), ATCC (Manassas, VA) and the Tulane National Primate Research Center (Covington, LA) (Table S1 ). Sequences were amplified by PCR using Phusion (New England Biolabs) polymerase using primers that anneal to the introns around exon 30 (primer sequences in Table S2 ). PARP9, 14 and 15 sequences were amplified from RNA isolated from cell lines (Table S1 ). Sequences were amplified by one step reversetranscription PCR using SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) to produce complementary DNA (cDNA) using the primers listed in Table S2 . Repeated attempts to amplify PARP15 from Siamang gibbon failed, supporting the conclusion that gibbons have lost PARP15. cDNAs were directly sequenced using internal primers by Sanger sequencing. Sequences from gorilla and squirrel monkey (Saimiri boliviensis) were obtained from publically available genome assemblies.",
