    "text": "The TRIM proteins are a family of proteins able to mediate antiviral activity against many different viruses [156] . The rodent specific TRIM79α was identified to interact with LGTV NS5 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. TRIM79α expression inhibited viral infection of LGTV and TBEV by mediating lysosomal dependent degradation of NS5. Interestingly this mechanism was quite specific to tick-borne flaviviruses as the mosquito borne WNV was not inhibited by TRIM79α nor did TRIM79α interact with NS5 of WNV [147] .",
