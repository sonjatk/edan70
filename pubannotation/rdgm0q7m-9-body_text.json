In the formula, the number of methionines in the stop, −1FS and −2FS products are denoted by MetS, MetFS1 and MetFS2 respectively; while the densitometry values for the same products are denoted by IS, IFS1 and IFS2, respectively. All frameshift assays were carried out a minimum of three times and the measured frameshift efficiencies (±SEM) are provided in the Supplementary Data.",
