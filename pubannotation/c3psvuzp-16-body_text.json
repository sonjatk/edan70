    "text": "Our finding that macrodomains encoded by macro-PARP genes have evolved under positive selection motivated us to investigate whether equivalent residues were rapidly evolving in each macrodomain. Such a conserved pattern could suggest that related genetic conflicts (for example, similar viral pathogens) drove their evolution. Instead, we observed that a different set of residues is rapidly evolving in each macro domain at a primary sequence level ( Figure 3C , Tables S6-S8 and Alignment S3). While equivalent amino acids are not evolving in all macro-PARPs, it is possible that positive selection has acted on a single threedimensional protein surface. We therefore modeled the positively selected residues from PARP9 and PARP14 macrodomains onto a structure that has been determined for the first macrodomain of PARP14 [48] . We found that positively selected residues map to a single surface of each macrodomain, but that each macrodomain shows positive selection on a distinct surface ( Figure 3D ). As each positively-selected surface is distinct relative to the site of ADPribose binding, these results suggest that ADP-ribose binding is not being altered or optimized by positive selection of the macrodomains. Instead, our findings suggest that each macrodomain has engaged in its own evolutionary arms race with as-yet-unidentified pathogen factors (see Discussion).",
