    "text": "Due to its activity directed against GNB, colistin is widely used for the control of PWD in pigs [10, 74] . Two surveys conducted in pig farms in Belgium, in 2006 [73] , and 2012 [74] confirmed that colistin was the most frequently used antimicrobial for the control of PWD, being mostly used prophylactically. However, colistin was underdosed in 90 and 53% of the cases, in the first and the second survey respectively. In Germany, it was reported that intestinal diseases in weaners were commonly treated with colistin, pigs being treated 9.7 days (median) per 100 days with this antibiotic, although tetracycline and tylosin were also used in approximately equal amounts [75] . In a study in France, it was reported that 90% of pig farms used colistin during the post-weaning period [10] . In Vietnam, a survey conducted on pig farms representing three different animal production systems (farm household, semiindustrial and industrial) showed that colistin was the most commonly used antimicrobial for prevention and therapy of gastrointestinal disorders in pigs [76] .",
