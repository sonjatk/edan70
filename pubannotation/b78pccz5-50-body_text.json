    "text": "where C i is the total indoor concentration (µg m -3 ) of the pollutant in question, C a is the concentration in the intake air, P is the probability of the pollutant remaining suspended after penetrating through the building envelope, α is air exchange rate (h -1 ), k is the deposition rate of the pollutant indoors (h -1 ), G is the indoor generation level (µg h -1 ), V is the volume and t is the temperature of the indoor space. The third term covering the transient impacts of changing concentration can be considered zero for the sake of long-term average exposures. Detailed input data and more details of calculations are presented in Hänninen and Asikainen (2013) [16] .",
