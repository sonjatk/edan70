    "text": "Rab23, Zfp451, Nostrin, Lrp2, and Ttn are candidate regulators of the pulmonary myocardium gene network The genes within the peak linkage regions were subsequently analyzed for known biological functions (GeneCards) (Safran et al. 2010 ) and expression in lung tissue [Fantom5 (Forrest et al. 2014; Severin et al. 2014) ; Table 3 ]. The Chr1: 33 6 1 Mb interval contained nine genes, with five of these (Prim2, Rab23, Bag2, Zfp451, and Dst) expressed in adult lung (Table 3) . Both Rab23 and Zfp451 have known functions that could implicate them in regulating gene expression of the pulmonary myocardium network. RAB23, a GTPase of the RAB family involved in vesicular trafficking, also exerts downstream transcriptional effects by antagonizing the action of the transcription factor GLI1 (Sun et al. 2012) . However, the function, localization, and mechanisms of action of RAB23 are still largely undefined. On the other hand, ZFP451 (zinc finger protein 451) is a promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body-associated transcriptional coregulator, and modulates transcription by regulating protein subnuclear localization (Karvonen et al. 2008) .",
