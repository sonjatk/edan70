    "text": "As derived from the correlation analyses (r s = 0.68), up to 46% of the monthly variation in occurrence of viral infections in our study could be explained by meteorological factors. However, the underlying reasons for the observed seasonal patterns demonstrated by these individual respiratory viruses are unclear. Climate could have a direct impact on virus survival, transmission efficiency, and host immunity, or have an indirect effect through climatedependent behavior change, such as indoor crowding and eating habits [55] . We detected more than one virus in 3.3% of the virus-positive NPA specimens, which is similar to what is reported using molecular methods detecting the same viruses as in our study [56] , but lower compared with studies using molecular methods detecting a wider array of viruses [57, 58] . The frequency of viral co-detections varies widely and depends on the number of diagnostic methods applied [59] and the number of pathogens tested for [58] . By employing multiplex PCR assays for 11 viruses, a study in 515 Korean children aged â‰¤ 5 years detected viruses in 312 (60.6%) of cases and a viral co-detection in 36 (11.5%) [45] . In addition to the seven viruses identified in our study, the Korean study also detected adenovirus, coronavirus, rhinovirus, and bocavirus; and, notably, the last virus was identified in 22 of the 36 co-detections. The clinical role of bocavirus in pneumonia in otherwise healthy children is unclear [60, 61] , as is the importance of multiple viral infections [57, 59] . Quantitative PCR methods to determine viral load in clinical specimens could provide valuable information on the pathogenetic role of each virus in such co-detections [61] , as could case-control studies.",
