    "text": "At present, there is still relatively little known about the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV. The highest incidence of severe disease is observed in elderly and immunocompromised individuals [11] . Those at general risk for infections are health care workers and people in close contact with dromedary camels [12, 13] . These groups are therefore considered relevant target populations for prophylactic vaccination against MERS-CoV infection and prevention of MERS. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) have listed MERS as priority target for vaccine development [14] . However, so far, no candidate vaccines have proceeded beyond phase I/IIa clinical testing [15] . One of these candidate vaccines is based on Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a safety-tested and replication-deficient vaccinia virus serving as an advanced viral vector platform for the development of new vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer (for review see [16] ). In that context, we still know relatively little about the correlates of vaccine induced protection against MERS-CoV. It is well-known that virus-neutralizing antibodies directed against the spike glycoprotein (S protein) correlate with protective immunity against coronavirus infections in general [17] [18] [19] [20] . Since the S protein is present on the cell surface, S protein is considered as the major antigen to induce virus neutralizing antibodies and as a key immunogen for the development of MERS-CoV candidate vaccines [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . However, based on current knowledge from the biology of Î²-coronaviruses, we hypothesize that also other viral proteins warrant consideration as immunogens and targets of virus-specific antibodies and T cells. Among those, the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) is produced at high levels in infected cells and has been proposed as useful candidate protein for clinical diagnosis [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . The coronavirus N proteins have been associated with multiple functions in the virus life cycle including the regulation of viral RNA synthesis, the packaging of the viral RNA in helical nucleocapsids, and in virion assembly through interaction with the viral M protein [31] [32] [33] [34] . Furthermore, several reports suggest that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) N protein functions as an immune evasion protein and an antagonist of the host interferon response [35] [36] [37] . Recently, the overexpression of MERS-CoV N in human A549 cells was found to be linked to an up-regulation of antiviral host gene expression including the synthesis of the inflammatory chemokine CXCL10 [38] . Despite this possible immune modulatory activity, SARS-CoV N-specific immune responses are reported to be long-lived and more broadly reactive when compared to SARS-CoV S-specific immunity [39] . Likewise, we were curious as to the suitability of the MERS-CoV N protein to serve as a vaccine antigen. The N protein is not present on the surface of MERS-CoV particles nor is it predicted to be expressed on the surface membrane of MVA infected cells. From this we hypothesized that the most relevant part of MERS-CoV N-specific immunity is based on CD8+ T cell responses relying on the processing and presentation of intracellular antigens. Currently, there is little information about MERS-CoV N-specific immune responses including the in vivo induction of N-specific cellular immunity.",
