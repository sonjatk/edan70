    "text": "The HPLC chromatogram of marker compound, lycorine, is shown in Figure 1(a) . The calibration curve of lycorine obtained with the developed HPLC method was linear over the range of concentration from 0.20 to 50 g/mL with a mean slope of 1493, mean intercept value of 177.8, and correlation coefficient of greater than 0.999. The within-day and between-day precisions and accuracies for the analysis of lycorine are shown in Table 1 . The accuracy values, expressed as percentage of true value, were between 95.38% and 104.75%, while the corresponding precision values expressed as correlation of variation (CV) were between 0.73% and 8.15% for both within-day and between-day analysis, thus indicating that the present HPLC-UV method was reliable and repeatable.",
