    "text": "The cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesions are described in Question 7. Lymphadenomegaly may be solitary or multicentric. Ocular lesions have been reported in approximately one third of the affected cats. Uveitis, either unilateral or bilateral (Fig. 1) , is the most common ocular lesion described, with occasionally a pseudotumoral granulomatous pattern and eventually progress to panophthalmitis [50, 53, 55, 64, 69] . Blepharitis and conjunctivitis have also been described in a number of clinical cases [66, 68, 70] . Amastigotes have been found by cytology in conjunctival nodules, corneal infiltrates and aqueous humor, and by histopathology after enucleation of the eye or post mortem even in uveal tissue [50, 53, 55, 64, 69] . Chronic gingivostomatitis is also a common clinical finding and has been found in about one fourth of the cats so far studied with leishmaniosis ( Fig. 2) [11, 26, 53, 55, 63, 66, 70] . Nodular lesions are unfrequently seen on the gingival mucosa or the tongue [60, 66, 69, 71] , where infected macrophages may be visualized in lesion biopses [60, 69] .",
