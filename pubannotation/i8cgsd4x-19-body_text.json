    "text": "To further establish this, Hsu cells were transfected with WNV-NS1, WNV-NS5 or WNV-NS3 genes with or without transfection with dsRNA against CxCul4. As a control cells were transfected with dsRNA against GFP. Cell lysates were collected 48 hours post-transfection. Western blot was performed using anti-CxSTAT antibody. The results showed decreased STAT levels in cells transfected with WNV-NS1 or WNV-NS5 (Fig 5D) . The levels returned to baseline in cells also transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4. In WNV-NS3 transfected cells, there was no significant change in STAT level. These results indicate that WNV infection of Culex cells leads to degradation of CxSTAT via CxCul4, activated by WNV NS1 and NS5.",
