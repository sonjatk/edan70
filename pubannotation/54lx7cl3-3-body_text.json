    "text": "A wide range of viral, bacterial and fungal agents can cause pneumonia when aspirated into the lungs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Etiology of Pneumonia in the Community (EPIC) study identified viruses as the most commonly identified etiologic agent in children and adults hospitalized with pneumonia. An etiologic agent was detected in 81% of 2222 children <18 years of age: 66% had one or more viral pathogens, 8% one or more bacterial pathogens and 7% both bacterial and viral pathogens [5] . Among 2259 adults, an etiologic agent was detected in 38%: 23% had one or more viral pathogens, 11% one or more bacterial pathogens and 3% both bacterial and viral pathogens [6] . However, virtually all these serious pneumonia cases were treated with antibiotics, as secondary bacterial infection can complicate lower respiratory viral infection. Therefore, even in cases determined to be pneumonia solely of viral etiology, bacterial interactions of virus and bacteria may play some role.",
