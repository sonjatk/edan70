    "text": "As shown in Fig. 3a -e, the retained functions of these proteins at each time point are depicted. Enriched functions of the DEPs at 12 hpi were mainly related to the cell cycle, including regulation of the mitotic phase of the cell cycle. At 24 hpi, numerous proteins involved in RNA processing were enriched. By 36 hpi, the DEPs were significantly enriched in proteins related to chromatin assembly (p = 1.88E-14). At 48 hpi, enriched functions were related to cellular macromolecular complex assembly (p = 3.91E-08) and regulation of organelle organisation (p = 2.99E-05). The functional terms in the regulation of apoptosis were enriched at each time point; but at 60 hpi, proteins involved in the regulation of apoptosis became the largest component (8.51%) of all DEPs.",
