Pairwise similarity (%) between the 35 vampire bat-associated Bartonella sequences from this study, calculated with Kimura's 2-parameters distance model. Sequences with greater than 96% similarity were assumed to be part of the same genotype for downstream analyses. (CSV) S3 Table. Pairwise similarity (%) between each vampire bat Bartonella genotype from this study and the top 10 BLAST hits from GenBank. (CSV) S4 Table. Bartonella-like reads and contigs detected in pooled saliva and fecal samples using metagenomics. Department describes where samples in a pool were taken. Bartonellalike reads were identified by Diamond protein blast, and read matches are a list of those that were identified as Bartonella based on nucleotide blast. Bartonella-like contigs were identified by Diamond protein blast, and contig matches are a list of those that were identified as Bartonella based on nucleotide blast. Length is contig length in base pairs, and K-mer coverage is the depth of coverage for the largest k-value used in the SPAdes assembly. Table) , and sequences from recent studies of bat and rodent Bartonella from Brazil. Bartonella seqeunces from our study are listed with genotype, bat ID numbers, and accession numbers. Sequences from GenBank are colored by host taxa and provided with accession numbers, host species, and sampling location; red tips display recent gltA sequences from Brazilian bats and rodents. ",
