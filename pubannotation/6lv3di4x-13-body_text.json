    "text": "The first observation made in these experiments was that IL-4 treatment of macrophages enhanced infectivity and virus replication of both strains of JEV ( Fig. 7A and Fig.  8 ). The second observation was that JEV harvested from NEC had enhanced infectivity for IL-4-treated macrophages (Fig. 7A ) and resulted in higher levels of replication in all macrophage cultures than obtained with virus grown in Vero cells (Fig. 7B) . This indicated the presence of additional factors released by epithelial cells with a potential to enhance infection of macrophages.",
