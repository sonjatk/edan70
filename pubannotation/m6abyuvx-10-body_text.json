    "text": "To determine whether rVV-N25 treatment induced the same effect in other strains of HCV transgenic mice, we analyzed RzCN5-15 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice, which express all HCV proteins; in these mice, chronic hepatitis was resolved within 28 days of immunization with rVV-N25. Taken together, these findings indicated that rVV-N25 had a dramatic therapeutic effect on both types of HCV transgenic mice ( Figure S4 ).",
