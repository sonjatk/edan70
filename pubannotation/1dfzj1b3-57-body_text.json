    "text": "However and generally we find other tests being utilized along with ABTS for evaluating free radical-scavenging capacity. For example, Satureja intricata Lange had ability for scavenging both DPPH and ABTS, whereas Satureja obovata Lag. did not possess such ability [77] . This behaviour could be attributed to the presence of thymol and its precursors p-cymene and Î³-terpinene, along with borneol in Satureja intricata. The essential oils of Artemisia herba-alba already reported above as possessing little ability for inhibiting lipid peroxidation [45] , when evaluated in terms of free radical scavenging, the oils continued to have weak activity. In this case and in contrast to other works [44, 51] , the essential oil of Artemisia herba-alba was not effective either against lipid oxidation nor as a free radical scavenger.",
