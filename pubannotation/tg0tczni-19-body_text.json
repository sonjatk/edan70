    "text": "Principal component analysis was carried out to identify the codon usage bias among ORFs. From which we could detect one major trend in the Axis 1 which accounted for 20.815% of the total variation, and another major trend in the Axis 2 for 16.273% of the total variation. A plot of the Axis 1 and the Axis 2 of each gene was shown in Additional file 1, Figure S1 . Obviously, those polioviruses belong to the same genotype tends to come together (except strain 48, isolated from Finland). Compared with the scattered groups of polioviruses genotype 1, genotype 2 and 3 strains aggregated more tightly to some degree. Although this graph is a little complex, it seems that there is a clear geographical demarcation in the polioviruses genotype 1 such as the VDPV strains isolated from USA, Dominica, China mainland and Taiwan. These may indicate that geographic is another factor on codon usage bias.",
