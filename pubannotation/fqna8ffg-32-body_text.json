    "text": "Nanoparticle exposure Mice were exposed with either pyrogene-free distilled water (Aqua ad iniectabilia, Braun, Melsungen, Germany) for sham groups or 20 μg CNP in 50 μl water for experimental groups by intratracheal instillation as described previously [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Briefly, mice were anesthetized via intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of medetomidin (0.5 mg/kg bodyweight), midazolam (5 mg/kg bodyweight), and fentanyl (0.05 mg/kg bodyweight) and intubated by a nonsurgical technique, using a cannula inserted 10 mm into the trachea, for instillation. For the time course experiments of 3 h up to 7 days after exposure, each of the eight experimental groups consisted of six mice, and for the BAL cell isolation experiments, each of the four experimental groups consisted of five mice. For the lung cell isolation experiment, each of the four experimental groups consisted of three mice, and these experiments were performed independently for four times.",
