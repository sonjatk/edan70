    "text": "To evaluate the characteristic features of these CN2-29 (+/2) / MxCre (+/2) mice, we analyzed serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and liver HCV core protein levels after poly(I:C) injection. As illustrated in Figure 1C , serum ALT levels increased and reached a peak at 24 h after the first poly(I:C) injection; this elevation appeared to be a direct result of the poly(I:C) treatment, which causes liver injury [11] . After this peak, serum ALT levels dropped continuously until day 4, and then ALT levels began to increase, as did HCV core protein levels. Thereafter, the HCV core protein was expressed consistently for at least 600 days.",
