    "text": "Potential gene targets for the endogenous control were identified from studies on other mammals (de Jonge et al. 2007 ). BLASTn (Altschul et al. 1990 ) was used to align gene sequences for the endogenous control candidates, using sequence data from the mouse (Mus musculus) and the 13lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus), the only available genome from the Sciuridae family (GenBank Accession number AGTP01000001-01024510) (Benson et al. 2010) . Conserved regions between the mouse and 13lined ground squirrel were assumed to be good candidates for sequence conservation between red and grey squirrels. Those conserved regions were then sequenced to investigate their suitability to amplify host DNA in a qPCR (as described in Online Resource S1).",
