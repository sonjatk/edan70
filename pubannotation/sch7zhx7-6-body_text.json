    "text": "Vero cells were treated with DFMO for four days prior to infection with CVB3 at MOI 0.1. After 24 h, 1/10th of the cell culture volume was used to inoculate the next virus passage. This process was continued for ten passages, at which time RNA was purified from the cellular supernatant, reverse transcribed, amplified using CVB3-specific primers, and Sanger sequenced. Sequences were aligned to CVB3 parental genome and mutants were confirmed by manual chromatogram verification.",
