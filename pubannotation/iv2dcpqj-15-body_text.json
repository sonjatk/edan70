    "text": "A previous study showed that NS5A decreases the CSFV IRES-mediated translation in a dose-dependent manner [13] . To examine the effects of eEF1A on the NS5A-mediated inhibition of the CSFV IRES activity, the luciferase reporter assay was used in this study. The results showed that eEF1A ( Figure 5A ), as well as NS5A ( Figure 5B ), inhibited the CSFV IRES activity in a dose-dependent manner. To further investigate the inhibitory effects of eEF1A and NS5A coexpression, eEF1A-and NS5A-expressing plasmids were cotransfected with the luciferase reporter plasmids into HEK293T cells. The results indicated that the eEF1A did not antagonize the inhibition of the IRES activity by NS5A when NS5A and eEF1A were coexpressed ( Figure 5C ). HEK293T cells were transfected with pMyc-eEF1A, pMyc-NS5A or pCMV-Myc. The cell lysate was incubated with the biotinylated CSFV IRES or PRRSV 3ʹ-UTR, followed by incubation with streptavidin beads. Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (MAb) (1:1000); (B) eEF1A interacts with the CSFV IRES in a dose-dependent manner. HEK293T cells grown in the 6-well plate were transfected with an increased amount of pMyc-eEF1A (0, 1, 2 and 4 μg), followed by streptavidin pulldown assay as described above; (C) Competitive RNA pulldown assay. HEK293T cells grown in the 6-well plate were transfected with the indicated pMyc-eEF1A (4 μg). The cell lysate was incubated with an increased amount of the IRES RNA (0, 0.75, 1.5 and 3.0 μg) for 1 h at 4 °C and incubated with the biotinylated IRES RNA and streptavidin beads. Bound proteins were subjected to immunoblotting using the anti-Myc MAb. or pMyc-NS5A. The cell lysate was incubated with the biotinylated CSFV IRES or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) 3 1 -UTR, followed by incubation with streptavidin beads. The bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (MAb) (1:1000); (B) eEF1A interacts with the CSFV IRES in a dose-dependent manner.
