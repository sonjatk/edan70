    "text": "We next compared the inhibitory effect of these two chimeras and the full-length M proteins on IFN-β expression using the luciferase reporter assay. Our previous study showed that the IFN-antagonizing activity of the SARS-CoV M protein is mediated by its N-terminal transmembrane domains, but the C-terminal domain has no effect. 32 When we swapped the C-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV M protein with that of the MERS-CoV M protein in the SN chimera, a similar suppressive effect on IFN-β promoter activity was observed ( Figure 5C ; bar 4 compared with bar 3), consistent with our previous results. 32 Likewise, when we swapped the C-terminal domain of MERS-CoV M with that of SARS-CoV M protein in MN, the chimera was capable of suppressing IFN-β promoter activity to comparable level ( Figure 5C ; bar 8 compared with bar 7). Given that the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV M protein possesses no suppressive effect, 32 the inhibitory activity of the MN chimera would be predominantly due to the N-terminal domains of MERS-CoV M protein. A biochemical assay also confirmed that the MN chimera maintained the ability to interact with the TRAF3 adapter protein in a co-immunoprecipitation experiment ( Figure 5D ; lane 2 compared with lane 1). Therefore, we concluded that the N-terminal transmembrane domains of the MERS-CoV M protein are required and sufficient for its innate immunosuppressive activity.",
