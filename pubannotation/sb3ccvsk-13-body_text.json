    "text": "Enhanced activation specifically in CLN of DT-treated DEREG mice during persistence may be polyclonal and/or driven by low levels of residual viral or auto-antigen presentation in CLN (12, 13) . The increased T cell effector cell phenotype indeed correlated with elevated levels of mRNA for T cell derived pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL-2 ( Figure 2D) . Although there is no evidence suggesting peripheral virus replication during persistent infection, the presence of JHMV within CNS-draining lymph nodes was indeed supported by detection of low levels of mRNA encoding the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein in control DTR − mice ( Figure 2D) . In contrast, increased T cell activation correlated with a reduction of viral N mRNA to below detection within CLN of DTR + mice at day 28 p.i. (Figure 2D ). Since IFN-γ has antiviral activity (31, 32) , elevated IFN-γ as a result of increased antiviral T cell activity in the absence of Treg is consistent with a decline in viral RNA.",
