    "text": "Previous studies have shown that the CPV NS1 protein exhibits anti-tumour activity in mammary tumours and skin tumours 13, 15 , but the complete mechanisms of its anti-cancer activity have not been revealed. In this study, we first identified a group of cancer-related proteins by a proteomics technique. Some of these proteins were not noted for CPV-induced apoptosis or anti-cancer function, which would provide a new perspective for studying the anti-cancer mechanisms of CPV.",
