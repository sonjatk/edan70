    "text": "To formally assess the dependency of measured prediction accuracy of results of a method on a given set of RNA we use bootstrap confidence intervals, a well-known statistical resampling technique [59, 60] . Following the recent work of Aghaeepour and Hoos [61] and Hajiaghayi et al. [58] we calculate the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval of average F-measure as follows. For each vector f of F-measures (where, for example, f may be the F-measures of predictions obtained by Iterative HFold on pseudoknotted structures) we first take 10 4 resamples with replacement, where the resamples have the same length as the original sample vector f (|f |), and then calculate their average F-measures. These 10 4 calculated average F-measures represent the bootstrap distribution for the vector f . We then report the 2.5th and 97.5th percentile of this distribution (i.e., the bootstrap distribution of the 10 4 average F-measures calculated above) as the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval respectively, and call it the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval. By reporting the bootstrap 95% percentile confidence interval for average F-measure of a method, A, on a data set, D, we say that we are 95% confident that the average F-measure of method A on data set D is in the reported interval. All calculations are performed using the \"boot\" package of the R statistics software environment [62] .",
