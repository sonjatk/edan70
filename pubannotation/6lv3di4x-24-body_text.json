    "text": "JEV infection of porcine nasal mucosa explants. Nasal mucosa explants were isolated from four 3-month-old pigs at a local slaughterhouse. The nasal cavity was opened in the longitudinal axes, and nasal mucosa was removed in strips (3 by 8 cm). After the tissues were rinsed with minimum essential medium (MEM; Thermo Fisher) supplemented with antibiotics (100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 g/ml of streptomycin, 0.25 g/ml of amphotericin B, and 50 g/ml of gentamicin; Sigma-Aldrich), they were placed onto sterile surgical compresses sodden with fresh MEM and kept on ice. Surgical compresses were cut in squares of 1.2 cm, placed in 12-well plates, and filled until the top of the compress surface with bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM [68] ), supplemented with antibiotics (see above). Next, the nasal mucosa tissues were cut in 1-cm squares and placed onto the compresses in 12-well plates and refilled with medium, keeping the apical side of the tissue at the ALI. After incubation overnight at 37°C in 5% CO 2 , mucus was washed away with BEGM, and mucosa pieces were transferred to new empty 12-well plates without compresses. There tissues were challenged with JEV at 10 5 TCID 50 s/ml in 400 l, incubated for 1.5 h at 37°C, and washed 3 times with BEGM. In order to establish again the ALI conditions, mucosa was transferred onto new freshly prepared 12-well plates with compresses and fresh BEGM with antibiotics. After 2, 24, and 48 hpi one piece of tissue per condition and animal was processed for RNA extraction. At 72 hpi, additional tissues were embedded and cryopreserved in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT; Leica Microsystems). Using a cryostat, nasal mucosa sections at a thickness of 4 m were cut and then fixed with acetone-methanol (1:1).",
