Early data, examining the pathogenesis of graft injury in liver transplant recipients with HCV infection, first reported that methylprednisolone treatment for acute rejection led to a 4-100-fold increase in serum HCV RNA [31] . Since then, an aggravated course of HCV reinfection after LT and increased resistance to antiviral therapy have been attributed to the application of specific immunosuppressive medication [32, 33] . Herein, various immunosuppression strategies have been evaluated for their influence on HCV recurrence.",
