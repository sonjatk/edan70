    "text": "Taken together, viperin has been shown to be an ISG that strongly inhibits tick-borne flaviviruses in vivo and in vitro. This strong antiviral effect on TBEV is mediated by targeting the virus at multiple steps of the life cycle. Interestingly, viperin targeting the synthesis of plus-sense RNA is dependent on the SAM domain or the C-terminal domain, while the N-terminal domain of viperin is responsible for interfering with virus assembly and release.",
