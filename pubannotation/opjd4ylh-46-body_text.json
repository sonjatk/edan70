    "text": "A study by ten Hoeve et al. [21] , found that one of the independent functions of a nurse is education. According to a study that was done by WHO [1] , healthcare professionals need to seek up-to-date scientific knowledge from national, and international, academic and research institutions, including professional associations. The findings of this study revealed that there was a lack of skills and in-service training in the wards. This finding concurs with those of a study conducted by Yang et al. [22] , which indicated various barriers contributing to poor TB treatment, such as communication difficulties, low literacy level, inadequate knowledge, and low awareness of TB disease.",
