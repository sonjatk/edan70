    "text": "Nurse (N3) said: \"Sometimes we are supplied with fake N95 masks or required to use surgical masks. We only get 21 masks per week, to share with social workers, doctors and other staff that come to the TB wards. We do not get enough gloves, and we do not have aprons. We sometimes lack soap to wash our hands after coming into contact with TB patients, and we also have limited washing basins. In addition, the windows are too small and there is poor airflow in the wards. UV lights are not regularly service.\" Nurse (N1) added that: \"This whole thing (emotional) of us being given fake masks results in negative practice for patient-care since we are afraid to contract TB. Each time we look at the patients we get scared of being in the same situation, hmmm, there are more negative thoughts in TB wards than positive ones.\"",
