    "text": "To identify the genomic intervals harboring genes that mediated variable expression, we performed genome-wide interval mapping and marker regression analyses for each transcript. The expression level of all transcripts varied by greater than twofold between BXD strains ( Table  2) . All transcripts except one (Sln, sarcolipin) had either a suggestive (LRS .10.4) or significant (LRS .17) eQTL that mapped to the hotspot regions on Chr1 and Chr2 identified in the cluster map (Table  2) . One transcript, Myh6 (myosin heavy chain 6, Chr14), varied by 2.62-fold between the highest and lowest expressing BXD strains (Figure 2B) , such that a significant trans eQTL could be mapped to Chr1: 33 6 1 Mb ( Figure 2C ). Of the remaining transcripts, 11 also had a suggestive eQTL overlapping the Chr1: 33 6 1 Mb region (Table 2) . Two additional transcripts had significant eQTL mapping to Chr1 (Doc2g, Chr19; Trnd, Chr10) but these did not overlap and were not replicated in more than one other transcript (Table 2) . Two transcripts, Kcnj3 and Tnni3 (Chr2 and Chr7, respectively), had overlapping significant eQTL on Chr2. For example, Tnni3 expression varied by 2.35fold between strains ( Figure 2D ) and a trans eQTL was mapped to Chr2: 68.8 6 0.4 Mb ( Figure 2E ). Of the remaining transcripts, 12 also had a suggestive eQTL overlapping the Chr2: 68.8 6 0.4 Mb region (Table 2) . A second eQTL peak on Chr2: 77.5 6 1 Mb also reached significance for one gene (Mybpc3, Chr2) and was a suggestive eQTL for seven additional transcripts (Table 2 ). Using the Tnni3 eQTL plot as an example, this Chr2: 77.5 6 1 Mb region had a suggestive LRS ( Figure  2F ). Since three significant eQTL intervals (Chr1: 33 6 1 Mb, Chr2: 68.8 6 0.4 Mb, and Chr2: 77.5 6 1 Mb) were mapped with suggestive LRS in multiple pulmonary myocardium transcripts, the genes within these regions were interrogated to identify putative upstream regulatory genes.",
