    "text": "Splenocytes were prepared as described above. Splenocytes were added to 96-well plates (1 × 10 6 cells/well) and stimulated for 6 h with MERS-CoV N-specific peptide (at 8 µg peptide/mL RPMI 1640 medium) in presence of the protein transport inhibitor Brefeldin A (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA; 5 µg/mL). Non-stimulated cells served as a background control and cells stimulated with 5 ng/mL PMA and 500 ng/mL ionomycin or with F2L peptide (8 µg/mL RPMI 1640 medium) were used as positive controls. After stimulation, cell surface antigens were stained using PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD3 (clone: 17A2, Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA), PE/Cy7-conjugated anti-mouse CD4 ",
