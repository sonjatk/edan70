    "text": "The findings of this study revealed that infection control and prevention are not available in TB wards. The nurses expressed a need for those. Nurses and patients were at a great risk of contracting TB infection in the wards. The findings of this study agree with those study by Tshitangano et al. [8] , which concluded that infection control plans are not available at the hospitals in Vhembe District, and this results in a high risk of TB infection transmission in the hospitals.",
