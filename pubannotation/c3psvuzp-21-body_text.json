    "text": "Our data do not exclude the possibility that other genetic conflicts, perhaps in addition to viral conflicts, drove PARP positive selection. Indeed, the first discovery of manipulation of host processes by ADP-ribosylation emerged from the study of bacterial toxins (e.g., diphtheria, cholera toxins) [49] , leaving open the possibility that bacterial or eukaryotic pathogens drove the evolution of PARP genes. However, we hypothesize that viruses may be significant or even the primary pathogens in these evolutionary arms races for several reasons. First, numerous viruses replicate poorly when ADP-ribosylation is inhibited, including viruses that replicate in the nucleus (HSV) [18] and cytoplasm (vaccinia) [17] . Second, several families of mammalian RNA viruses, including corona-and togaviruses, have nonstructural proteins that contain macrodomains. In both coronaand togaviruses, disruption of viral macrodomains has been shown to reduce virulence [20, 21] , and in the case of coronaviruses, this reduced virulence is due to increased sensitivity to the antiviral activity of interferon (IFN) [21] . This suggests a simple model in which the macrodomains (at least in coronaviruses) are required to counteract some IFN-stimulated host gene product. Although the identity of that IFN-stimulated factor is unknown, we note that several of the rapidly evolving PARP genes we identify here, including PARP9, PARP13 and PARP14, are upregulated by IFN [50, 51] . Furthermore, overexpression of PARP9, independent of IFN, is sufficient to upregulate several known antiviral effectors [50] . Finally, overexpression of several PARP genes has been shown to inhibit replication of viruses, the most well-described example being PARP13. Taken together, we favor a model in Tables  S6-S8 ). (B) P-values derived from PAML tests of positive selection on all sequenced macro-PARP orthologs using either macrodomains alone, the entire gene minus the macrodomains or just the catalytic domain. Values in red indicate strong evidence of positive selection, while those in grey indicate a lack of statistically significant evidence for positive selection. (C) Phylogenetic tree of individual macrodomains from macro-PARPs, rooted using human MacroD2 as an outgroup. Macrodomains in italics lack a C-terminal extension found in most macrodomains and lack one or more of the putative catalytic motifs required for ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity [16] (Figure S5 ). This suggests these macrodomains may be able to recognize, but are unlikely to catalyze removal of, ADP-ribosylation. To the right is a schematic of each macrodomain with positively selected residues indicated in red (posterior probabilities greater than 0.95) (see also Alignment S3). (D) Location of positively selected sites in PARP macrodomains mapped on to the structure of the first macrodomain from PARP14 in complex with ADP-ribose (PDB code: 3Q6Z) [48] . ADP-ribose is shown as blue sticks. Residues shown as red surfaces are those that have evolved under positive selection in the indicated macrodomain. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004403.g003 which PARP gene evolution has been driven primarily by genetic conflicts with viruses.",
