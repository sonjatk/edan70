    "text": "Immunization with rVV-N25 suppressed HCV protein levels in the liver, and this suppression was associated with ameliorated pathological chronic hepatitis findings (see Figure 3 ). Importantly, rVV-N25 treatment did not cause liver injury based on the serum ALT levels; therefore, this treatment was unlikely to have cytopathic effects on infected hepatocytes. These findings provided strong evidence that rVV-N25 treatment effectively halted the progression of chronic hepatitis. Immunization with plasmid DNA or with recombinant vaccinia virus can effectively induce cellular and humoral immune responses and exert a protective effect against challenge with HCV infection [20, 21] . However, findings from these previous studies revealed HCV immunization of both uninfected, na√Øve animals and immune-tolerant animals induced a HCV-specific immune response. In the model describe here; the animals were immune competent for HCV; therefore, our findings provided further important evidence that rVV-N25 was effective in the treatment of chronic hepatitis.",
