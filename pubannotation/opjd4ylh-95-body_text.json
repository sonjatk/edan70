    "text": "The study highlighted the plight of nurses when caring for patients suffering from tuberculosis. Nurses indicated their emotional distress due to fear of contagion, lack of material resources, as well as poor infection control practices. The Occupational Health and Safety Act stipulates measures and standards of practice, however such standards are jeopardized by inadequate financial and resource allocation in the public sector. Nurses expressed the need for in-service education and support by managers. Managers must ensure that nurses have resources to maintain quality nursing care and receive social and psychological support as they face death on a daily basis. While available resources are limited, there is a need to direct resources to the problem, to improve quality of services in the TB wards.",
