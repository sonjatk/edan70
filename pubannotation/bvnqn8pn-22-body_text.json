    "text": "Exacerbations. The existence of seasonal cycles of asthma exacerbations is well established [7, 14, [16] [17] [18] . Children frequently experience a worsening of asthma when they return to school after the summer break; the peak of this \"September asthma epidemics\" is around 2 weeks after the start of school [7, 14, 16] . In 2006, Johnston and Sears examined data from the Canadian Institute of Health Information and found a clear seasonal pattern in ED visits and hospitalizations for asthma, showing, for the 5-15 years' age group, a relatively stable trend for the first 6 months of the year, a trough in the summer months, and then a rapid and substantial increase in mid-August, reaching the peak 2 weeks after return to school; in children aged 2-4, the pattern was similar but the peak less striking [16] . More recently, Cohen et al. analyzed data from 82234 asthmatic children and found that unscheduled primary care physicians visits and drug prescriptions for asthma were fluctuating during the first part of the year, had a decline in the summer months, and peaked in September with a lower peak in autumn [7] . Similarly to what is reported in the literature, our data show an increase in ED visits for asthma in early autumn, but with a difference between children aged 0-5 and â‰¥6 years (Figure 4 ). In the younger group, the peak starts in September, reaches its maximum in October, and then continues for the whole autumn and early winter. In the school-aged children, there is a peak only in September which is, however, lower than that observed during the spring, mainly in April and May.",
