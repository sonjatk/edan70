    "text": "The infection caused by MERS-CoV has an average incubation time of 5 days (2-14 days range). The host, in this time period, shows no symptoms of infection. The clinical symptoms of the disease range from mild symptoms of upper respiratory infection like cough, fever and myalgia to severe forms such as pneumonitis, as well as respiratory failure. Patients may also suffer from abdominal pain, appetite loss, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and other gastrointestinal symptoms. The less commonly occurring symptoms include hemoptysis and diarrhea without any hint of fever [29] . Studies advocate that chronic illnesses, such as chronic heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes and hypertension, increase the risk of MERS-CoV infection and its severity [30] , though further proof is required.",
