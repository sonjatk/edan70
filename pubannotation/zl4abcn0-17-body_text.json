    "text": "extracts analyses using HPLC-UV were carried out in two parts. The first part involved the quantification of the compound lycorine in methanolic extracts of different parts of H. littoralis, namely, root, bulb, stem, leaves, flower, and anther. The second part involved the quantification of the compound lycorine in callus extracts produced by using different combinations and concentrations of plant growth regulators (PGRs). Sample preparation for HPLC analysis was carried out by accurately weighing 2 mg of each dried extract, which was then dissolved in 2 mL of HPLC-grade methanol to give a concentration of 1 mg/mL. These samples were then filtered through a 0.45 m syringe filter (Whatman, Maidstone, England) and kept in fridge at −20 ∘ C prior to HPLC analysis.",
