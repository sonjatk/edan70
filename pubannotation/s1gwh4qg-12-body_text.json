    "text": "SNAD has a menu that controls output display interactively. By default, output includes ID-to-name log in which selected information about generated names is detailed in table format that can be downloaded as an Excel file. This table can be useful for controlling the name generation procedure and preparing legends to accompany an alignment or a phylogenetic tree in publication. The user can also extract IDs from submitted alignment or tree by activating \"names only\" option, or retrieve annotation from cognate entries in table format. In the current implementation of SNAD, the most time-consuming stage is data retrieval from databases. For large queries and complex name formats, also using API, it is therefore advisable to start with less than 10 sequences to design a format to be used for the full query. Queries containing up to 500 IDs and including sequence alignments up to 50000 characters can be processed through SNAD web page. For queries containing more than 500 IDs, the user is advised to use one of the SNAD APIs.",
