    "text": "Pigs are highly susceptible to JEV infection and rapidly develop viremia, which can last for a few days, during which they can transmit the virus to mosquitoes (4, 6) . Infected pigs normally present mild neurological symptoms, but the infection of pregnant sows can cause abortions and stillbirth (7) . Although JEV infection is typically mosquito borne, contact transmission and high susceptibility to oronasal infection have been described (8) . Several in vivo experiments demonstrated that JEV can be excreted oronasally in infected pigs, independently of the route of inoculation, for a period of 5 days, with a maximum level of virus shedding reached after the end of viremia (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Furthermore, mathematical modeling using data from outbreaks in Cambodian pig farms supported the possibility that direct transmission also occurs under field conditions (13) . These findings represent a warning that JEV could have the potential to continue to circulate in the pig population by direct transmission in temperate regions during cold mosquito-free periods. In fact, a reemergence of JEV in pig farms located in temperate areas after the winter season without the presence of vectors has been reported in Hokkaido Island in northern Japan (14) . It is also important to note that vector-free transmission of mosquito-borne flaviviruses is not restricted to JEV and pigs. Several species, including macaques, mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats, and squirrel hamsters, are susceptible to oronasal infection with JEV (15) (16) (17) . In addition, nonvector-borne transmission has been described for other flaviviruses (18, 19) . Examples are Zika virus (ZIKV) (20, 21) , West Nile virus (WNV) (22, 23) , St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) (24) , Bagaza virus (BAGV) (25) , Tembusu virus (TMUV) (26) , and Wesselsbron virus (WESSV) (27) .",
