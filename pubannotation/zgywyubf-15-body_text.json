Direct interaction between ORF2 and βTRCP was further confirmed using an in vitro pulldown assay. Full-length ORF2 as well as KDEL ORF2 (ORF2 protein containing \"KDEL\" amino acids at its C-terminal end, which allows it to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum instead of getting transported through the golgi) and Δ35 ORF2 mutant were able to pull-down βTRCP ( Figure 4C, lane 3, 4, 5) . As negative controls, ORF2 transfected sample was immunoprecipitated with pre-immune serum ( Figure 4C , lane 6) or mock translated lysate was incubated with ORF2 protein bound to beads ( Figure 4C, lane 2) or, the ORF3 protein was incubated with βTRCP protein ( Figure 4C, lane 7) .",
