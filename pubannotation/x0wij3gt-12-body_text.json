    "text": "Normal bronchial epithelial cells were plated at the indicated densities (2 Ã— 10 3 cells/well) in 96-well multiwell culture plates (Costar). Cells were treated with inhibitor or antagonist for 2 h before exposure of the cells to PGE 2 in the culture medium (containing 10 % FBS). In separate experiments, cells were transfected with control, PDK1, EP4 or c-Jun siRNAs or expression vector for 40 h before exposure to PGE 2 for up to 4 days. Cell proliferation was evaluated using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, a homogenous method of determining number of viable cells in culture based on quantitation of the ATP present which signals the presence of metabolically active cells.",
