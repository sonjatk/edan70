    "text": "Threats to wildlife conservation and human and animal health transcend national borders and require transboundary collaborations among multidisciplinary experts to mitigate them. Regional scientific collaborations can strengthen diplomatic relationships, foster exchange of knowledge and resources among researchers, and inform regional policies to address shared threats. This is particularly important in regions identified as potential zoonotic disease hotspots that have largely been overlooked, such is the case for Western Asia. To fulfil this regional gap, EcoHealth Alliance (EHA), a global non-profit organization dedicated to protecting wildlife and public health, formed the Western Asia Bat Research Network (WAB-Net, \"wah-bee-net\") in collaboration with key regional stakeholders in Western Asia in 2018. The WAB-Net aims to promote collaborative research to improve regional capacity for One Health approaches to mitigate threats to bat populations that also facilitate viral spillover. Given the challenges and research opportunities identified for Western Asia above, there is a critical need to link bat research with public health initiatives in order to achieve \"win-win\" solutions for bat conservation and zoonotic disease prevention.",
