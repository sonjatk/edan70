    "text": "During the last 10 years there has been an increase of POWV in the USA with approximately 100 reported cases [54, 55] . The recent rise in incidence could be due to increased surveillance and diagnosis of POWV, or it may represent a true emergence of the disease in endemic areas, or both [55] . The incubation period ranges from 1 week to 1 month. The symptoms of POWV infection may include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, and memory loss with a case fatality rate of 10% [54] . Approximately half of the survivors experience permanent neurological symptoms, such as recurrent headaches, muscle wasting, and memory problems (https://www.CDC.gov). There are no antiviral treatments or vaccines available against POWV.",
