    "text": "POWV is found in Russia and North America, and is the only TBFV present in America ( Figure 1 ) [48] . It is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis, Ixodes cookei, and several other Ixodes tick species, to small and medium size mammals, whereas humans are accidental dead-end hosts. Milk-borne POWV transmission might also be possible since POWV virus has been found to be secreted in milk under experimental settings [49] .",
