The concentration with the smallest detectable peak, at a noise-to-signal ratio of 3, was taken as the limit of detection (LOD), whereas the lowest concentration with acceptable accuracy and precision at noise-to-signal ratio of 8 was taken as the limit of quantification (LOQ). The linearity of the calibration curve was evaluated by linear regression analysis.",
