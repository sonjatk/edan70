    "text": "While a web interface is available for visualizing the data within the SEED (http://pubseed.theseed.org), this interface is inadequate to make full effective use of the massive quantities of data now embodied within the SEED. To truly expose the SEED data for efficient large-scale use by the global scientific community, we initially developed a Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) server to allow the needed programmatic access to the SEED data [21] ; however, the SOAP server could not scale up with the increased volume of data. To cope with the increasing demands placed on the SEED web services, as well as the increasing volumes of data included within the SEED resources, we developed a secondgeneration of web services to improve throughput, response time, and access to SEED functionality. Here, we describe in detail the four primary servers now available for remotely accessing SEED data and we describe the client-side distribution of server scripts that we provide as examples of how the servers may be applied to perform complex analyses of genome data.",
