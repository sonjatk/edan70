    "text": "To further investigate the protective efficacy of N3 antibodies against EV71 infection in vivo, 1-day old hSCARB2-transgenic mice were preinfected with 1610 7 pfu of E59 subcutaneously (s.c.) followed by administration of N3 or isotype antibody (200 mg) i.p. for 3 h post infection. Mice were monitored for sign development on a daily basis. Mice treated with isotype antibody exhibited visible hair loss associated with scurfy skin peaked on Day 6 post infection, and the skin scurf/rash gradually disappeared after Day 7 post infection. Administration of N3 to E59-preinfected mice reduced the skin lesions to a relatively mild degree from Day 4 post infection onwards ( Figs. 2A and 2B) . Moreover, prechallenge of 7-day old hSCARB2-transgenic mice with a lethal dose of 1610 5 pfu 5746 [11] caused progressive limb paralysis from Day 4 onwards and led to death if the mice remained untreated or isotype antibody treated (Figs. 3A and 3B). Mice receiving N3 treatment 3 h post infection were protected from the development of paralysis and were subsequently rescued from lethal infection.",
