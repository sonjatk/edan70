    "text": "Markets may play a key role in amplification of disease transmission [37] . The CTS explicitly states whether a movement went through a market and, if so, which market was used. This allows us to construct networks that include markets as nodes. The above-listed sampling schemes can all be applied to this situation. There is significant uncertainty regarding the level of contact of animals from different batches (farms) on a market, and therefore the risk of transmission between animals during their stay on the market. For this reason, we investigate the effect of two extreme assumptions of transmission within a market (electronic supplementary material, figure S3 ). In the first scenario, we assume no within-market transmission, such that infection is only transmitted between the source and the destination farm. We assume complete segregation between herds being strictly enforced (this would be equivalent to having no markets in the network). In the second scenario, we assume no segregation and no biosecurity at rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org Proc. R. Soc. B 282: 20150205 a market, such that all batches that move through a market mix with one another homogeneously. In this case, we use the CTS data to determine which batches of cattle move through a market. When an infected batch moves to a market, that market becomes infected and we then assume that infection can be transmitted to all possible destination farms (as determined based on the destinations of all batches that move from the market) with an equal probability. A graphic depicting how the network is altered by the inclusion of markets is shown in the electronic supplementary material, figure S3 , and pseudo-code for the updated epidemic process is shown in the electronic supplementary material, algorithm 2.",
