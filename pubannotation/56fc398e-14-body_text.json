    "text": "In the node sampling schemes, a 'sampled' node has all its edges sampled. A node is said to be 'captured' if it is connected to a sampled node but it has not been sampled itself. For all of these schemes, we assume that the total number of nodes N in the network is known. We sample a set S of N S nodes and capture N C nodes, the N S sampled nodes plus their connected non-sampled neighbours. This method will therefore preserve the degree of the initially sampled nodes N S , but for the remaining nodes that are captured, only the edges that link them to the N S nodes will be recorded.",
