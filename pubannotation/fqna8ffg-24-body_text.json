    "text": "Our observations, seem contradicting with the well described ability of AMs to produce a great number of pro-inflammatory cytokines upon the phagocytosis of environmental particles, a process caused by classical activation of these cells [19] . Also carbon black particles had been reported to generate ROS, cause a transient increases of intracellular calcium, and subsequently lead to the expression and release of TNFα in rat AM via activation of NF-KB and AP1 [53] . Therefore, our initial expectation was that lung macrophages contribute to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to recruit circulating neutrophils to the alveolar space. In this context, we also exposed primary AMs and cells of the murine alveolar macrophage cell line MH-S to CNP in vitro, at doses up to 100 μg/ml. In contrast to Browns finding, we could not detect any induction of TNFα transcription or protein release. Yet exposure of MH-S cells to ambient PM 2.5 effectively caused TNF expression and release, as did LPS [57] . The different outcomes for the similar carbon black particles might eventually be related to the different doses used. We however think that in vitro doses beyond 100 μg/ml medium are too excessive and likely to cause artefacts.",
