    "text": "Similar to HotKnots, the ShapeKnots method of Hajdin et al. [47] is a heuristic algorithm for prediction of pseudoknotted structures. This method incorporates SHAPE reactivity data as a pseudo energy term into the prediction method. SHAPE reactivity data is only available for a limited number of RNA sequences, so we cannot compare Iterative HFold with ShapeKnots on our data set. Therefore, we use data set of Hajdin et al. to compare these two methods. In their data set Hajdin et al. have 18 RNA sequences in their training set and 6 RNA sequences in their test set. We run Iterative HFold with hotspots for each RNA sequence and choose the lowest http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/147 energy structure as the final output of our program. For Shapeknots, we use the sensitivity and positive predictive values reported in the work of Hajdin et al. [47] to compare with Iterative HFold. Table 5 shows the results of this comparison. In all but one sequence of the test set, Iterative HFold obtains higher accuracy than ShapeKnots. The exception is the HIV-1 5' pseudoknot domain; Hajdin et al. note that the accepted structure of HIV-1 5' pseudoknot domain is based on a SHAPE directed prediction and thus an accuracy comparison between ShapeKnots and Iterative HFold may be biased towards ShapeKnots. In the training set, however, Iterative HFold does not perform as well as ShapeKnots. This might be because parameters of ShapeKnots were tuned on the training set to achieve the highest possible accuracy. Since both the training and test data sets are small, we cannot make more general statements about the significance of the differences in accuracy between the two methods.",
