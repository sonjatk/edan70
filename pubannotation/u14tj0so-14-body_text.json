    "text": "All of Iterative HFold's underlying methods use the energy model of HotKnots V2.0 DP09 [36] ; with this model, HFold obtained predictions with higher accuracy than those obtained with our earlier implementation of HFold. One of Iterative HFold's underlying methods is HFold-PKonly, which given the input structure only adds pseudoknotted base pairs. HFold-PKonly is especially useful for cases when the user has either complete information about the true pseudoknot-free structure or wants to check whether a single stem of the input structure can be part of a pseudoknot since, if the input structure only has the specific stem in question, the output structure of HFold-PKonly will determine if the given stem can be part of a pseudoknot.",
