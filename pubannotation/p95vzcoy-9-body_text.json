    "text": "White-eyed honeybee pupae were obtained from sealed worker brood frames of two local A. mellifera colonies and then microinjected laterally between the second and third segment of the abdomen with 2 µL of a solution containing DWV [52] . The pupae were then incubated at 34.5 • C, ≥50% relative humidity and darkness for seven days [53] and afterward frozen at −80 • C. The DWV solution was prepared by homogenizing a DWV symptomatic honeybee in PBS and chloroform, followed by centrifugation (15800 rcf for 10 min). The supernatant was collected, diluted 1:1000, and frozen at −80 • C before injection into the pupae [52] . For the injected honeybee pupae used as food and positive controls for the virus detection, the logarithmic mean number of viral copies was 11.49 ± 0.29 and DWV type-specific primers showed a ratio of 5.88/1 for DWV-B to DWV-A, but no DWV-C.",
