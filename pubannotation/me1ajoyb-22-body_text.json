    "text": "Infectious diseases and the immune response are complex processes that are challenging to study, even with substantial reagent resources and mature methodologies. Many difficulties exist for studying hantavirus infections of their reservoir hosts, including the lack of molecular and immunological reagents, methods for experimental investigation, and that few reservoir species have been colonized for laboratory use. In addition, pathogenic hantaviruses require BSL-3 and/or ABSL-4 containment, which presents logistical hurdles for examining the reservoir host/hantavirus relationship. Despite these limitations, novel instrumentation, particularly those for transcriptome profiling (e.g., RNA-Seq) and metabolomics, and development of molecular and cellular methods, provide an opportunity to rapidly develop the tools necessary for examining reservoir host responses using a systems biology approach. The key feature of these new technologies is that they are species-independent in the data they generate, but they require significant computational and bioinformatics resources.",
