    "text": "Crystallization trials were performed using the hangingdrop vapour-diffusion method. Crystals grew at 293 K in 2 ml drops comprised of equal volumes of protein solution and reservoir solution consisting of 20%(w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate. The crystals were soaked in soaking solution [0.1 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.5, 20%(w/v) PEG 3350, 10%(w/v) glycerol, 5 mM diplacone, 5%(v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide] for 2 h at 293 K. The crystals were cryoprotected by transfer into cryoprotectant [20%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 10%(v/v) glycerol, 0.2 M ammonium sulfate] and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen for data collection. A complete data set for Cp-NanI CD with diplacone at 1.9 Å resolution was collected at 100 K using an ADSC Q315r detector on beamline 5C at Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) using an X-ray beam with a single wavelength (0.9795 Å ). The crystal belonged to space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 , with unit-cell parameters a = 69.1, b = 72.6, c = 97.1 Å . Diffraction data were processed and scaled using the HKL-2000 suite research papers (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) . The structure of Cp-NanI CD with diplacone was determined using the molecular-replacement method with MOLREP (Vagin & Teplyakov, 2010) in the CCP4 suite using the apo crystal structure of Cp-NanI CD (PDB entry 2vk5; Newstead et al., 2008 ) as the phasing model. Automated model building and refinement of NanI CD complexed with diplacone were performed with REFMAC5 (Murshudov et al., 2011) in the CCP4 suite and phenix.refine (Adams et al., 2010) . phenix. ligandfit (Terwilliger et al., 2006) was used for automated ligand building of the diplacone in Cp-NanI CD , and manual model building was performed with Coot (Emsley & Cowtan, 2004) . Weak electron-density regions (residues 692-694) were excluded from the final structure. The Ramachandran statistics were calculated using MolProbity (Chen et al., 2010) . 96.2% of the residues were in the preferred regions and 3.8% of the residues were in allowed regions. A 2F o À F c composite OMIT map of diplacone contoured at 1.0 was generated with FFT (Read & Schierbeek, 1988) in the CCP4 suite. The atomic coordinates and structure factors of Cp-NanI CD with diplacone have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with accession code 4l2e. Data-collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1 .",
