    "text": "Cordia verbenacea D. C. essential oil significantly reduced TNF-α levels but not IL-1β production in the subcutaneous tissue of the rat paw injected with carrageenan [112] . Some authors showed that from the essential oil of Cordia verbenacea, only α-humelene was able to reduce significantly the increase of TNF-α and IL-1β levels in the subcutaneous tissue of the rat paw after LPS treatment [113] or in carrageenan-injected rats, whereas (-)-trans-caryophyllene diminished only TNF-α release [114] .",
