    "text": "The use of cytokines or neutralizing cytokine antibodies to perturb the host response during infection has identified many mechanisms that contribute to susceptibility or resistance. For example, administration of IFNγ to laboratory mice facilitates clearance of LCMV, whereas antibody that neutralizes IFNγ impairs CTL responses and clearance, thus leading to persistent infection [110, 111] . Depletion of immune cell subsets with antibodies can also determine the roles of those cells during infection. This approach revealed a critical role for CD4 + T cells for sustaining CTL responses to LCMV [112] . Other than the Norway rat, an array of cytokines and antibodies for experimental manipulation of the host response of hantavirus reservoirs is substantially limited. Thus, it is difficult to determine the mechanisms controlling the host response of reservoirs. Some cytokines are broadly cross-reactive and can be used for studying reservoir responses. Recombinant house mouse GM-CSF and human IL-2 stimulate deer mouse cells [113] , and it is likely that other commercially-available cytokines can also be used. Identification of cross-reactive cytokines should be a high priority of the hantavirus community. With genome and transcriptome sequencing, many cytokine genes can be rapidly cloned into expression vectors that are codon-optimized for the expression system of choice using de novo synthesis services (e.g., GeneArt, Life Technologies). Moreover, some antibodies may be cross-reactive with reservoir species' orthologs [114] . Anti-mouse CD4 (clone GK1.5) and anti-rat CD8β (clone 341) antibodies can be used to deplete CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from hamsters, respectively [74, 86] , and they may also be useful for reservoir host studies to examine the roles of these cells.",
