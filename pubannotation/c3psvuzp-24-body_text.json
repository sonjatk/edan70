    "text": "Likewise, our data highlight macrodomains as likely focal points of host-virus conflicts. However, in contrast to PARP4, which we hypothesize is on the 'offense' i.e., specifically targeting viral proteins, the widely distributed pattern of positively selected sites within the macro-PARPs is reminiscent of other host immunity factors that are evolving on the 'defensive' side (i.e., directly targeted by viral antagonists) of evolutionary arms races [34] . In these cases, the host factor is performing a general antiviral function, such as shutting down host mRNA translation in the case of the antiviral protein PKR (Protein Kinase R), or transducing an antiviral transcriptional program as in the case of the antiviral protein MAVS (Mitochondrial Antiviral Signaling). As a result of their broad action, PKR and MAVS are antagonized by an array of proteins from diverse viral lineages that interact with different regions on the proteins [53, 54, 55, 56, 57] . The widely distributed pattern of positive selection in PKR [58] and MAVS [59] likely reflects this 'defense' against (or escape from) multiple antagonists. We postulate that the dispersed pattern of selection we observe in PARP9, 14 and 15 similarly reflects selection to escape recognition by a variety of distinct viral antagonists of a hypothesized PARPmediated antiviral response (see below), rather than selection to maintain or establish recognition of viral target proteins.",
