    "text": "Seong and Matzinger discuss in their highly stimulating review paper [60] , how hydrophobic portions of exogenous particles or molecules can serve as ligands for different pathogen or damage associated molecular pattern such as Toll-like receptors and thereby induce an inflammatory response. From that view one might expect that especially pure carbon particles, characterized by high hydrophobicity such as the here investigated CNP, should trigger such an ancient innate immune responses via the activation of respective damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) receptors. First in vitro evidence for this interaction could be provided by exposure of splenocytes, to gold nanoparticles of different hydrophobicity [36] . Counter-intuitively and in contrast to this appealing hypothesis however our results deny an early exposition of DAMPs on the alveolar surface, as these motives would certainly cause immediate macrophage activation which we detected for LPS (Additional file 1: Figure S5 and S6), but not CNP IT. It is possible that the lung lining fluid and the thereby generated nanoparticle corona plays a protective role.",
