    "text": "In recent years, microRNAs (miRNA) have been identified that are important regulators of antiviral responses. Activation of TLR/RIG-I pathways leads to the expression of several miRNAs [98] that likely are important in lymphocyte functions [99] . Because hantavirus Gn targets RIG-I [61] , it is possible that these miRNAs are dysregulated, which could provide the virus an advantage over the host cell response. While miRNA expression has been evaluated in hantavirus-infected human endothelial cells, epithelial cells and macrophages [100, 101] , no work has been conducted to examine the role of miRNAs in reservoir host cells infected with hantaviruses. Considering the importance of miRNA in host responses, it is likely they play an instrumental role in the immunological events leading to persistent infection of the reservoir hosts. The use of RNA-Seq can identify global miRNA expression [102] and clarify their regulatory roles in infected reservoirs.",
