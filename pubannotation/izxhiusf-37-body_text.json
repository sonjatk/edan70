    "text": "The frequent upper respiratory tract colonisation with these aerobic bacteria in children, may provide difficulties to discriminate between contamination and true bronchial infection [25] . However, we consider our results to reflect true bronchial infection, as we applied procedural methods, which were shown to limit strongly the risk for contamination [13, 20, 26, 27] . In particular, we chose to use a cut-off of ≥10 4 cfu/ml for bacterial BAL-culture, although in adults a cut-off of ≥10 3 cfu/ml has demonstrated to be discriminative [28, 29] . The applied cut-off was also used previously by others, studying children with chronic bronchitis [30] . Moreover, although FOB + BAL were only performed once in the majority of patients, our results probably reflect chronic bronchial infection as all our samples were collected during stable clinical state.",
