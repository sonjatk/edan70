    "text": "During the tick bite, the virus is inoculated into the skin of the vertebrate host. The initial replication is believed to occur locally in the dendritic cells. This is followed by infection of the draining lymph nodes, resulting in the primary viremia and subsequent infection of the peripheral tissues, where further replication maintains the viremia for several days [37] [38] [39] [40] . The disease course of TBEV is biphasic; the initial phase is characterized by flu-like symptoms and is followed by a second phase involving CNS infection, with meningitis, encephalitis, or meningoencephalitis [41] [42] [43] . The mortality rate of TBEV varies from 1 to 20% depending on the subtype, in which the European TBEV subtype has shown lower mortality rates compared to the Siberian and Far Eastern [23, 40, 44] . Among the patients that experience neuroinvasive TBEV infection, approximately 25-40% of the survivors suffer from long lasting neurological sequelae [45, 46] . No antivirals are available for treatment of TBEV infection but there is an effective vaccine [25, 47] . LGTV, which is closely related to TBEV, is found in south east Asia and Russia [17] . LGTV has not been associated with human disease under natural infections although it shares 84% sequence identity with TBEV [17] . Because of its avirulence in humans and close similarity to TBEV, LGTV is often used as a model virus for TBEV under biosafety level-2 conditions.",
