    "text": "Tissue Culture Extracts. The developed method was used to quantify the amount of lycorine in extracts of various parts of the H. littoralis wild and tissue culture samples. Lycorine contents in those samples were calculated using external standard method and summarized in Table 2 while their representative chromatograms are shown in Figures 1(a)  and 1(b) . On the other hand, the contents of lycorine in extracts of callus samples are given in Table 3 while their representative chromatograms are shown in Figure 1 (c). The wild plant extract and callus (initiated from 4.5 M 2,4-D alone and 9.00 M 2,4-D with 4.5 M BAP combination) were statistically analyzed. There was significant production of lycorine in callus compared to wild type plant extract.",
