    "text": "Interrogation of related signaling pathways with the KEGG pathway tool revealed enrichment for \"dilated cardiomyopathy,\" \"cardiac muscle contraction,\" \"hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,\" and \"calcium signaling pathway\" genes (Table 5) . Similarly, analyses with the WikiPathway tool demonstrated enrichment for \"striated muscle contraction\" and \"calcium regulation in the cardiac cell\" (Table 5 ). In agreement with the GO and pathway results, the pulmonary myocardium gene coexpression network was enriched with higher order muscle phenotypes such as \"abnormal cardiac muscle contractility,\" \"abnormal cardiac tissue morphology,\" and \"abnormal heart size\" (Figure 3 ). Enrichment for pathways related to both abnormal contractility and calcium signaling/regulation led us to investigate the ion channels and regulatory proteins expressed in the extended gene network.",
