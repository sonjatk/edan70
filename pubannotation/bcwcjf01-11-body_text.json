    "text": "A plasmid control was generated to determine the error rate of the PCR and sequencing steps as described previously [17] . PCR products were prepared for sequencing using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Sequencing of an aliquot of a subset of 40 samples was carried out by Eureka Genomics, Hercules, CA using an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx. Another aliquot of the same samples plus an additional 4 samples were set for 454 sequencing at the Brigham Young University DNA",
