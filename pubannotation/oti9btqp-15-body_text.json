    "text": "Specific anti-ZIKV antibody responses in sera from vaccinated RM were assessed by ELISA. At week 6, rZIKV-E-specific binding antibodies were detectable in animals vaccinated with ZIKV-prME ( Figure 4b ). Endpoint titres were determined for each animal at week 2 (after 1 immunisation) and week 6 (after 2 immunisations; Figure 4c ). The ELISA results were confirmed by western blot analysis using RM sera from the individual vaccinated animals ( Figure 4d ). The neutralisation activity of the antibodies generated in RM at week 6 was evaluated by a PRNT 50 assay. All the vaccinated monkeys had significant neutralisation activity with anti-ZIKV reciprocal PRNT 50 dilution titres ranging from 161 to 1380 (average 501 Â± 224 standard error of the mean; Figure 4e ). PRNT titres did not directly correlate with ELISA titre (data not shown).",
