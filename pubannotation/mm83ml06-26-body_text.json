    "text": "By blocking the deubiquitination of Gag, the DIs P22077 and PR-619 should also increase steady state levels of poly-ubiquitinated Gag and thus its entry into the UPS. To address this issue, HeLa cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) and syngag expression plasmids, and treated for 12 h with indicated concentrations of DIs. The ∆PTAP mutant, which was shown to display elevated levels of ubiquitinated Gag, was assessed in parallel [25, 30] . To avoid rapid proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitinated Gag species following DI treatment, cells were incubated with the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and Lactacystin (LC) 4 h prior to cell lysis. After immunoprecipitation with Gag-specific antibodies, western blot analyses were performed and ubiquitinated Gag species were detected by anti-HA staining (Figure 8 ). Following co-expression of syngag wt and HA-Ub, a faint pattern of high molecular weight species was observed, which most likely represents polyubiquitinated Gag. Upon treatment with 14 μM PR-619 or 20 μM P22077, the intensity of the HA-Ub-signal was clearly increased and exceeded even the ubiquitination-levels of the ∆PTAP mutant. Similar amounts of precipitated Gag were confirmed by anti-CA staining. Thus, treatment with P22077 or PR-619 enhances polyubiquitination of Gag. In our previous studies, we demonstrated that the measurement of the presentation of Gag-derived epitopes on MHC-I molecules at the cell surface represents a highly sensitive and reliable approach to follow the entry of Gag into the UPS [26, 32, 48, 67] . To investigate whether DI treatment leads to enhanced antigen presentation, we measured the presentation of Gag-derived epitopes on MHC-I molecules at the cell surface as described previously [26, 32, 33, 48] . After transfection of the syngag-SL expression plasmid into HeLa cells, which stably express the murine MHC-I allotype H2-K b (referred to as HeLa-K b cells) [68] , flow cytometry analyses revealed a concentration-dependent increase in SL presentation after treatment with P22077 or PR-619 ( Figure  9A ). Addition of 10 μM P22077 or 7 μM PR-619 led to a 3-fold increase in SL presentation, while addition of 14 μM PR-619 caused an even 10-fold increase in the SL presentation. To exclude that the enhanced antigen presentation was due to elevated levels of H2-K b complexes at the cell surface resulting from DI treatment, the amount of total H2-K b was quantified, showing similar amounts of H2-K b molecules at the cell surface after treatment with P22077 and PR-619 compared to untreated control ( Figure 9B ). In our previous studies, we demonstrated that the measurement of the presentation of Gag-derived epitopes on MHC-I molecules at the cell surface represents a highly sensitive and reliable approach to follow the entry of Gag into the UPS [26, 32, 48, 67] .

Taken together, these results indicate that DIs, especially those targeting USP7 and USP47, not only inhibit HIV-1 replication but also lead to an enhanced polyubiquitination and thus entry of Gag into the MHC-I pathway.",
