    "text": "The superoxide anion scavenging activity of Portuguese Thymus oils were evaluated by the enzymatic hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase system [53] . From the 28 essential oils evaluated, only Thymus zygis ssp. sylvestris and Thymus capitellatus collected in diferent places of Portugal had superoxide anion scavenging activity >50%. In Thymus zygis ssp. sylvestris prevailed thymol or carvacrol, whereas in Thymus capitellatus oils, borneol and 1,8-cineole dominated. Such results seem to indicate that the phenolic compounds are not the only ones able to scavenge superoxide anion, as already reported for hydroxyl radical scavenging [53] .",
