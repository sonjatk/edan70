    "text": "Although plasma cell infiltration as outlined above is intriguing, a similar pathological response is seen in a number of inflammatory conditions such as anti-N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) encephalitis [85] , primary sclerosing cholangitis, [86] multiple sclerosis, [87] and responses to tumors [88] . Some, such as IgA nephropathy and rheumatoid pericarditis have shown plasma cell infiltration and IgA staining [89] . In KD it is proposed that these plasma cells mature in situ from initial B cell infiltration. Monoclonal B cell infiltrates have been shown in other disorders [90] . Additionally, in situ lymphoid neogenesis is described in numerous inflammatory and infectious disease systems [91] [92] [93] [94] and some oncologic processes [95, 96] . Localized inflammation and cellular damage may lead to exposure of previously hidden self-antigens setting off a localized autoimmune cascade [97] . From pure pathological studies, it is unclear if the clonality of the IgA+ plasma cell infiltrates seen in KD represents a global inflammatory response or a specific antibody driven response against an invasive pathogen.",
