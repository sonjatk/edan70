    "text": "(2) treatment 1 (T1) colonies (N = 6) were fed for four weeks with DWV-infected honeybee pupae and then for eight weeks with D. hydei; (3) treatment 2 (T2) colonies (N = 6) were fed for eight weeks with DWV infected honeybee pupae and for 4 weeks with D. hydei. D. hydei were chosen as food for the controls, because honeybee pupae taken from local Swiss colonies inevitably contain background levels of DWV [54] . Sugar water (40% mass fraction of sugar) supply ad libitum was maintained. Then, ten adult workers were randomly sampled from each colony over four consecutive weeks until the end of the experiment (week [13] [14] [15] [16] and stored at −80 • C until further processing. The different feeding regimes were chosen to see if there is an impact of feeding duration on virus uptake and the time gap since the last feeding of the virus until the first sampling should reduce the risk of detecting DWV in the ant's gut content [55, 56] . Some colonies were not large enough to provide adults, thereby decreasing sample size at the last sampling (C -N = 1; T1 -N = 5; T2 -N = 6).",
