    "text": "Research on bats in Western Asia is fragmented, both temporally and spatially. Past research efforts have focused largely on cataloging the bat diversity in a single country [88] [89] [90] [91] or adjacent countries in the region (i.e., Arabia [92] and Caucasus [93] ). These initial efforts contributed some of the first information about bat systematics, ecology, behavior, and geographic distributions in Western Asia. However, a recent resurgence in bat research is reshaping our understanding of the distribution of bats in the region, including new country records [94] [95] [96] [97] and updated species' distributions [98] [99] [100] [101] . The growing number of new distributional records, as well as taxonomic revisions [102, 103] and new species discoveries [96, 104] , published within the last decade points to a clear need for continued bat diversity assessments and field research throughout the region.",
