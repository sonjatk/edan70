    "text": "With resistance mutations emerging in CVB3 2A and 3C proteases, we next hypothesized that these mutations may enhance viral replication in polyamine-depleted cells by maintaining proteolytic activity. To test this, we generated mutant 2A 29K and 3C 52R proteases through site-directed mutagenesis of our overexpression vectors. We then cotransfected these proteases and the wildtype ",
