    "text": "When compared to their effect on other viruses, as for example Influenza virus, IFITMs display a milder antiviral phenotype against HIV-1 ex vivo. However, this does not preclude an important role of IFITMs in shaping HIV-1 quasi-species evolution in vivo, possibly as part of the more complex interferon response. An increasing number of reports indicate that the susceptibility of HIV-1 to IFNÎ± changes during the course of the disease in infected patients [50, 51] and HIV-1 strains displaying increased resistance to IFITMs have been selected ex vivo [52] . These results suggest that the evolutionary pressure exerted by IFITMs on HIV-1 is likely not neutral. In this respect, it will be of interest to determine whether multiple primary HIV-1 strains display distinct susceptibilities to IFITMs and whether particular IFITM haplotypes can be associated to distinct HIV-1 outcomes, as is the case for Influenza virus [13] .",
