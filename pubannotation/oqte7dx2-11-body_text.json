    "text": "Mammalian USP46 and USP12 are comprised largely of a core catalytic domain that exhibits low intrinsic activity (Cohn et al., 2009; Kee et al., 2010; Faesen et al., 2011) . Biochemical and proteomic studies showed that two WDR proteins, WDR48 (also known as USP1-associated factor, UAF1) and WDR20, interact with USP46 and USP12 (Cohn et al., 2009; Sowa et al., 2009; Kee et al., 2010) . WDR48 stimulates the activity of three DUBs, USP12, USP46 and USP1, a DUB which regulates the Fanconi anemia DNA damage pathway (Cohn et al., 2007 (Cohn et al., , 2009 Faesen et al., 2011) . WDR20 forms a unique ternary complex with WDR48 and either USP12 or USP46 (Sowa et al., 2009; Kee et al., 2010) and further enhances their catalytic activity in vitro (Kee et al., 2010; Faesen et al., 2011) . Intriguingly, a large-scale proteomic analysis of DUB-interacting proteins in HEK293 cells revealed that 36% of the 75 DUBs analyzed interact with a WDR protein, suggesting a broad role for WDR proteins in regulating DUBs (Sowa et al., 2009) .",
