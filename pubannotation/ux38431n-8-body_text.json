    "text": "We defined a case of SARI according to the World Health Organization case definition for all hospitalised children in whom the onset of illness occurred within 7 days of admission [22] . Basic demographic and clinical information and laboratory results were recorded for each patient using a standardised form. Specimens were collected on the day of admission. Two separate banks of specimens between May 2007 and March 2010 were used in this investigation. The first set consisted of 259 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) specimens collected from paediatric patients with SARI in Beijing (Northern China). The second specimen bank comprised 293 induced sputum (IS) specimens from paediatric patients with SARI in Zhejiang Province (Eastern China). All of the samples were collected from the patients at the first day of admission and placed in viral transport medium and stored at -80Â°C until tested.",
