    "text": "An initial assessment of the ability of the assays to be multiplexed was carried out by comparing C p values obtained with the same DNA templates but with primers used in uniplex, duplex and triplex reactions. A mixture of previously identified positive samples was used to create a DNA template that was positive for the IC and both of the target genes. Multiplex qPCRs were run as 20 μl final reaction volumes that contained 4 μl 5 × QuantiTect® virus Master Mix (Qiagen, Manchester, UK), appropriate amounts of each primer and probe (Table 1 ) and ca. 50 ng template DNA. Thermal cycling conditions were 5 min at 95°C, followed by 50 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 75 s at 60 C. PCR efficiencies of reliable multiplex qPCRs were assessed using serial dilution of standards (10 7 -10 2 copies and 5 7 -5 2 copies) with five reactions per dilution. As neither virus is readily isolated in cell culture, we modified the qPCR protocol of O'Callaghan and Fenech (2011) to quantify the amount of target DNA. Briefly, known quantities of synthetic oligonucleotides (Eurofins MWG Operon, Edersberg, Germany, or Integrated DNA Technologies, Leuven, Belgium) (see Online Resource S2) for calculations to determine number of copies based on molecular weight of the oligonucleotides), whose single-stranded DNA sequences are those of the control and target genes that binds the probe, are used to create a standard curve against which the amount of target DNA in the unknown samples can be calculated (O'Callaghan and Fenech 2011). With no gold standard assay for either target and therefore no confidence about a 'truly negative' sample, Lambda (λ) DNA (Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK) was added to the serial dilutions to ensure the same quantity of DNA overall in each qPCR (Online Resource S3). Only multiplex qPCRs with efficiencies between 90 and 110 % for all assays were retained.",
