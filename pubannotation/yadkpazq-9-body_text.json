    "text": "PBMCs were seeded immediately after isolation at a concentration of 3 × 10 6 cells/mL in 96-well U-bottom plates. Triplicate cultures for each cat were treated with either 4 μg/mL ODN 2216 or 2243 or an equal volume of endotoxin-free PBS. After an initial incubation of 18 h, the cells were pulsed for 24 h with 3 H-thymidine (Perkin Elmer, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland). Standard liquid scintillation protocols were used for harvesting of the cells and uptake of 3 H was assessed with the Packard Tri-Carb 1600TR liquid scintillation analyzer (Perkin Elmer). Proliferation rates were calculated as the mean counts per minute (c.p.m) of triplicate cultures. The stimulation index (SI) depicted in Figure 1 was calculated as follows:",
