We removed them from our data set, resulting in a set of size 425. From now on we use \"HK-PK\" to refer to the pseudoknotted structures in this set (with 88 structures) and \"HK-PKfree\" to refer to the pseudoknot-free structures in this set (with 337 structures). RNA sequences in HK-PK and HK-PK-free have length between 10 and 400 nucleotides.",
