    "text": "Comparing accuracy of Iterative HFold and HotKnots V2.0 on HK-PK, HK-PK-free, DK-pk16 and IP-pk168, we found that the difference in their accuracies is insignificant on HK-PK, HK-PK-free and DK-pk16 data sets when Iterative HFold is provided with HotKnots hotspots as input. Based on our results on the HK-PK data set, with only about 15% information about the true pseudoknot-free structures, Iterative HFold's 95% percentile confidence interval is (65.08%; 73.36%) (data shown in Additional file 3). If the user has about 35% information about the true pseudoknot-free structure, Iterative HFold's accuracy is comparable with that of HotKnots (i.e., (74.18%; 82.30%) vs. (73.60%; 83.35%)). However Iterative HFold's accuracy (with hotspots as input) is significantly better than that of HotKnots on the IP-pk168 data set. One of the advantages of Iterative HFold over HotKnots is that in Iterative HFold base pairs are added to lower the energy of the given structure while in HotKnots stems are added in a way that does not take into account the energy of stems in the previous steps.",
