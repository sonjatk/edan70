    "text": "Carbon nanoparticles (CNP) were generated by spark discharge from graphite electrodes as previously described [47, 69] . The sterile and pyrogene-free produced particles consist of over 96 % pure carbon and primary particles are characterized by an isometric/spherical shape with a diameter of 7-12 nm and a specific surface area of 800 m 2 /g [12, 49] . CNPs were dispersed in pyrogene-free distilled water (Aqua ad iniectabilia, Braun, Melsungen, Germany) at a concentration of CNP 0.4 μg/μl and sonicated twice for 30 s with a probe sonicator (SonoPlus HD70, Bachofer, Berlin, Germany) at 30 % amplitude (70 W) on ice. CNP dispersions showed a mean agglomerate size of 0.19 μm, measured by dynamic light scattering (Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS). The absence of endotoxins and pyrogens from the particle preparation was approved by LIMULUS assay and even more relevant by in vitro studies using different murine macrophage cell lines (data not shown).",
