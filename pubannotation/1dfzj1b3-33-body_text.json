    "text": "The antioxidant activity of Thymus essential oils from Portugal were the target of study in [53] . The authors studied the capacity of preventing lipid peroxidation through the same method described by [52] and they found that Thymus zygis subsp. zygis and Thymus zygis subsp. sylvestris oils obtained from different regions of Portugal showed good antioxidant activities, even better than that of BHT. Carvacrol, thymol, p-cymene and Î³-terpinene predominated in the oils, although in different percentages.",
