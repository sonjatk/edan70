    "text": "Although ICR-and BALB/C-suckling mice were reported to be susceptible to genotype C of EV71 infection to induce neurological pathology using a mouse-adapted but not clinically isolated virus in these experiments [8, [23] [24] [25] or using the natural strain of EV71 in type I/II interferon-deficient newborn mice [6] . The lack of a relevant animal model has hampered the development of effective prophylactic and therapeutic approaches. Previously, We had developed and demonstrated that challenge of newborn hSCARB2-transgenic mice with B genotypes of EV71 isolates, the early syndrome of HFMD, followed by progressively neurological LP were developed. In addition, hSCARB2-transgenic mice elicit more susceptibility than the reported newborn mouse models for C genotype of EV71 infection which resulted in lethal neurological diseases. Despite the muscle-tropic EV71 viremia in the reported model that differ from the CNS-tropism of EV71 infection in humans, hSCARB2-transgenic mice were characterized as bi-pathological tropism in the CNS and peripheral sites [11] .",
