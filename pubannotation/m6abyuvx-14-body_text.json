    "text": "Viral clearance is usually associated with CD4 and CD8 T-cell activity that is regulated by cytolytic or noncytolytic antiviral mechanism [14] . To determine whether CD4 or CD8 T-cell activity was required for the reduction in HCV core protein levels in the livers of transgenic mice, we analyzed the core protein levels in CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice immunized with rVV-N25 in the absence of CD4 or CD8 T cells ( Figure 4A ). As expected, the mice lacking CD4 or CD8 T cells failed to show a reduction in HCV core protein levels ( Figure 4B ).",
