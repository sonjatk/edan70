    "text": "Having established a role for PDK1 in PGE 2 -stimulated normal bronchial epithelial cell proliferation, we examined whether the effects of PGE 2 on PDK1 expression occur at the transcriptional level. We found that PGE 2 induces the expression of PDK1 mRNA (3.462 ± 0.103 vs 1.000 ± 0.020 in BEAS2B, P <0.01; 6.218 ± 0.138 vs 1.008 ± 0.069 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.01) (Fig. 1f ) and activity of PDK1 gene promoter (1.666 ± 0.177 vs 1.000 ± 0.039 in BEAS2B, P <0.05; 2.714 ± 0.187 vs 1.000 ± 0.043 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.01) (Fig. 1g) . We therefore conclude that PGE 2 increases cell proliferation in normal bronchial epithelial cells by activation of the PDK1.",
