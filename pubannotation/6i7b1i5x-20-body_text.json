    "text": "As reviewed, the similarly cloned antibody E was shown to bind a self-antigen [102] . The autoimmune aspects of KD have recently been reviewed [118] . Self-antigen responses to a variety of targets have actually been well described in KD. These include recent reports of antibody responses to type III collagen, myosin [119] , cardiolipin [120] , alpha-enolase [121] , and anti-endothelial antibodies. Anti-endothelial antibodies are particularly interesting as these are seen in other disorders, such as SLE and renal allograft rejection [122] . Other vasculitides have also been associated with anti-endothelial antibodies. These have been shown to cause upregulation of E-selectin, VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and NFÎºB [123] . Responses to these antibodies include upregulation of inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis of the endothelial cells.",
