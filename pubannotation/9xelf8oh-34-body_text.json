    "text": "Due to the apparent localised SQPV infection that grey squirrels displayed (Fig. 2 , see also (Atkin et al. 2010 ), diagnosis in this species can prove problematic particularly as no one single tissue can reliably be used to indicate grey squirrel SQPV infection status. While previous attempts to use swabs to diagnose a SQPV infection in grey squirrels failed to identify infected individuals (Collins et al. 2014) , swab samples provided several benefits in this study. Swabs allow multiple sites and a greater sampling area to be surveyed without concern for overloading the sample with host DNA. Thus, a single swab sampling the oral, eye and distal arm areas investigated would identify all infected individuals in this study and is recommended as the sampling method of choice in both squirrel species for SQPV detection alone (Table 2) . Adding a rectal swab (potentially combined with the cutaneous swab) and blood would make one confident in detecting the majority of SADV cases while also performing analysis for SQPV. It should be noted, however, that reliability of using swabs depends upon the use of the endogenous IC that indicates adequate harvesting of cells (via amplification of squirrel DNA).",
