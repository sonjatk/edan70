    "text": "Aloe vera ( [43] . More examples of 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors included some Salvia essential oils from South Africa. The authors attributed such activities to the presence of 1,8-cineole, α-pinene and βcaryophyllene in the essential oils [98] . The same major components present in the essential oils of four indigenous South African Helichrysum species were also reported to inhibit 5-lipoxygenase [99] . Chamazulene and α-bisabolol are examples of other components, present in the essential oil of chamomile, with anti-inflammatory activities partly due to the inhibition of leukotriene synthesis since they appear to be good 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors [17] . The essential oils of leaves and rhizomes of Alpinia murdochii Ridl., Alpinia scabra (Blume) Náves and leaves of Alpinia pahangensis Ridl. also showed to be good 5-lipoxynease inhibitors. β-Pinene, α-pinene and sabinene were the main components of the leaf oils, whilst the sesquiterpenes γ-selinene, α-selinene and α-panasinsen predominated in the rhizome oils [100] . The oils Torreya nucifera Siebold et Zucc. oil, mainly constituted by limonene, δ-3-carene and αpinene, was a COX-2 selective inhibitor having significant inhibitory effects on PGE 2 production [101] . 1,8-Cineole, a terpene oxide, present in many essential oils was shown to inhibit leukotrienes (LTB 4 ) and prostaglandins (PGE 2 ), both pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism [102] .",
