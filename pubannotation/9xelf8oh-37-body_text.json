    "text": "In conclusion, the use of appropriate chemistries and software allowed straightforward development of two multiplex assays that allow fast processing of samples while simultaneously producing more reliable results (and at a reduced cost) than published assays. Increased sensitivity had provided new information about the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the target pathogens. While these new assays have specific benefits for epidemiological investigations into the diseases of squirrels, it is hoped this work will have a wider impact by stimulating development of further multiplex qPCRs that will maximise information collected from investigations into multi-pathogen systems, which are becoming increasingly important as knowledge of co-infection dynamics increases (Telfer et al. 2010) .",
