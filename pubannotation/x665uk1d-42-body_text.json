    "text": "Representative 3 mm-thick brain tissue sections for immunohistochemical analysis were mounted on silane-coated slides as described by Ramos-Vara [49] . Anti-PRV gpD antibody (Jeno Biotech Inc.) was used as the primary antibody (1:100) and was applied for 60 min at RT. The samples were then treated for color development with the DAB Detection Kit (Ventana Medical Systems, Germany). The viral envelope fuses with the cell membrane and delivers the viral capsid into the cytoplasm. Viral DNA synthesis begins shortly after the appearance of the beta proteins and the temporal program of viral gene expression ends with the appearance of the gamma or late proteins, which constitute the structural proteins of the virus. Finally, the virus undergoes a lytic cycle. B. Expression model of 3D8 scFv proteins. 3D8 scFv proteins were localized in cytosol using a vector system and targeted in the nucleus by nuclear localization signal. Therefore, 3D8 scFv proteins in SCH07072 were present in both the cytosol and nucleus. C. 3D8 scFv has a unique dual and stereoscopic protection mechanism that includes DNase activity in the nucleus and RNase activity in the cytoplasm. 3D8 scFv acts by inhibiting (1) ",
