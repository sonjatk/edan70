    "text": "For the in vitro plant, callus culture samples were obtained via tissue culture method. To initiate callus culture, the meristematic tissues of the bulb were cultured in semisolid Murashige and Skoog [21] media. Various concentrations of 2,4-D alone (2.25, 4.50, 9.00, 13.50, 18.00, and 22.50 M) and also with combination of 4.50 M BAP and 2.25, 4.50, 9.00, 13.50, 18.00, and 22.50 M of 2,4-D were used for the initiation of callus. For each concentration, four explants were cultured on the semisolid MS medium in a single culture jar (59 mm × 66 mm). It was then repeated three times which made up to a total of 16 replicates (4 explants × 4 jars). Finally, the cultures were kept in culture room under dark condition at 25 ± 2 ∘ C. Developed callus was collected after four weeks and dried in the oven at 50 ∘ C.",
