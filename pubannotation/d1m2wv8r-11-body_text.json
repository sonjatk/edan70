    "text": "A summary of the 615 quantitatively DEPs obtained by method 1 are shown in Supplementary Table S1 . The quantitatively DEPs selected at each time point by method 2 are listed in Supplementary Tables S2.1 To analyse the potential functions of the significantly DEPs at each time point, we then performed a gene ontology enrichment of biological processes using DAVID software for the proteins obtained by method 2. Generally, gene ontology terms are enriched by David software without fuzzy heuristic clustering. So, an overwhelming number of terms were generated, which were too difficult to analyse. In order to reduce the redundant terms, we re-analysed them by \"Functional Annotation Clustering, \" and only the term with the minimum p-value in each cluster was reserved. As a result, 60/79, 57/77, 22/33, 119/166, and 91/135 of the biological process terms at each time point were removed.",
