    "text": "CoV nsp1 is a serious virulence factor, which facilitates the biological actions of MERS-CoV. Studying the nsp1 can advance our understanding of pathogenicity of MERS-CoV and facilitate development of better therapeutics. Host gene expression in infected cells is suppressed by MERS-CoV nsp1, which also promotes virus assembly or budding in in vitro, leading to efficient virus replication, suggesting nsp1 is also critical for MERS-CoV replication and promotes production of virus particles in the host [42] . The severity of MERS-CoV infection is relatively more in patients with co-morbid conditions, such as chronic lung disease, renal failure, diabetes and others with compromised immune systems [9] .",
