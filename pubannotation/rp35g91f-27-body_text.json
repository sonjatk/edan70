    "text": "The Chr2: 68.8 6 0.4 Mb interval contained nine genes, three of which were expressed at appreciable levels in adult lung (Lass6, Nostrin, and Lrp2) but only two had known roles in gene regulation (Nostrin) or cell signaling (Lrp2) ( Table 3) . Nostrin has been shown to be required for vascular development and angiogenesis by acting as a molecular conduit for fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1)-mediated induction of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1) activity (Kovacevic et al. 2012) . Interestingly, Nostrin has been shown in both mice (Kim et al. 2005 ) and humans (Wiesenthal et al. 2009 ) to bind to and negatively regulate transcription of its own promoter via a centrally located bZIP DNA binding motif (Bae et al. 2014) .",
