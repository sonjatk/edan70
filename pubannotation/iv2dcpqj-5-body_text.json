    "text": "The eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), one of the most abundant protein synthesis factors, constitutes 1% to 4% of the total soluble proteins in actively dividing cells [16, 17] . The canonical function of eEF1A is to bind aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) in a GTP-dependent manner and deliver it to the A site on the ribosome during protein synthesis [18] . eEF1A is also involved in non-canonical functions including turnover of misfolded proteins, nuclear export events, binding and bundling of the actin cytoskeleton, apoptosis and the viral life cycle [19, 20] . eEF1A contains three well-defined domains: the domain I binds to GTP; the domain II binds to the aminoacyl end of aa-tRNA, the domains I and II bind to the eEF1B complex, and the domain III is linked to actin binding [19] .",
