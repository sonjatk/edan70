    "text": "During the 2009-2010 H1N1 outbreak, mutations within H1N1 accumulated at a relatively constant rate ( Figure 1 ). The strains sequenced at the end of the pandemic had approximately 80 more mutations than the 2009 reference genotype. The line of best fit reveals a slope of 42.1 mutations accumulated per year (3.2 Ã— 10 -3 mutations per site per year). Given that the data were collected from viral strains circulating worldwide, the correlation between mutation count and the date of collection was surprisingly good (r 2 = 0.77).",
