    "text": "The sensitivity of the LAMP reaction was assessed in two ways: copy number detection and background in which 10 copies of the target could be detected. Copy number detection was measured by serial dilutions of known amounts of DNA containing the target sequences, either as genomic or plasmid DNA ( Figure 3 ). Reactions fail in both assays at DNA molecule number of less than 1 which is consistent with the stochastic probability of a target being present [7] .",
