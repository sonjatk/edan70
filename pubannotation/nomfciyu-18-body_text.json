    "text": "Development of humanized monoclonal antibodies against emerging viral diseases requires a significant production cost and poses as a major drawback. To overcome this obstacle and to reduce the cost, extremely powerful neutralizing mAbs which can be given in smaller doses without compromising the efficacy is needed. One strategy to achieve this could be to design humanized mAbs with exceptional binding attraction and targeting them against the potential targets, such as RBD.",
