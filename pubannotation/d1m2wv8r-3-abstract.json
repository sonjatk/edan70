    "text": "The CPV genome contains two open reading frames; by alternative splicing, one produces two mRNAs encoding two non-structural proteins (NS1 and NS2), and the other transcribes two mRNAs encoding two structural proteins (VP1 and VP2) 3 . The VP1 and VP2 proteins contain the most important antigenic epitopes, which are targeted by neutralising antibodies. VP2, which represents 90% of the viral capsid, also functions as a viral ligand that determines the viral host specificity and tissue affinity 4 . NS1, a pleiotropic phosphoprotein, is thought to be a culprit of apoptosis of CPV-infected cells. For instance, NS1 of CPV-2 has been shown to induce caspase-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis 5 .",
