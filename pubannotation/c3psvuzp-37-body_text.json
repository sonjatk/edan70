Other primate species may have different exon numbering. Residue numbering corresponds to this reference sequence. 2 Residues with recurrent signatures of positive selection with a posterior probability greater than 0.95 were identified using a Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis in PAML from the F364 codon frequency model. 3 Estimated dN/dS ratios from PAML. 4 Estimated errors for the indicated dN/dS ratio.
