    "text": "Similar to C. elegans, the genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melonagaster encodes for one DUB, CG7023, that is homologous to both USP46 and USP12 (Moretti et al., 2012; Tsou et al., 2012) and one homolog each of WDR48 and WDR20 ( Table 1 ). CG7023/USP12 was shown to negatively regulate Notch signaling in flies (Moretti et al., 2012) . Partial RNAi knock-down of CG7023/USP12 in the fly nervous system did not reveal any obvious neuronal phenotypes (Tsou et al., 2012) . It will be informative to investigate the null phenotype of the WDR proteins and USP12 in the fly nervous system.",
