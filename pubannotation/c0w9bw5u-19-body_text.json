    "text": "In our study, TRAF3 was also shown to interact with the MERS-CoV M protein ( Figure 4A ). In line with this, the adapter function of TRAF3 in TBK1 recruitment and subsequent IRF3 activation was perturbed by MERS-CoV M protein ( Figures 4B-D) , which plausibly contributed to the IFN antagonism of the MERS-CoV M protein (Figures 1-3) . The MERS-CoV M protein is a transmembrane protein that was shown to co-localize with markers of the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi intermediate compartments in the perinuclear area. 22 Although TRAF3 is known to adapt the mitochondrial transducer MAVS, it is not associated with mitochondria but rather with the Golgi apparatus and ER-Golgi intermediate compartments in unstimulated conditions, 30, 54 rendering it susceptible to interaction with the MERS-CoV M protein. Upon stimulation with ligands or viral infection, TRAF3 appears on membrane-bound fragments originating from Golgi. Retention of TRAF3 in ER-to-Golgi compartments and inability to form Golgi fragments rendered IFN-Î² expression inefficient. 54 Therefore, whether TRAF3-containing Golgi fragment formation is affected by MERS-CoV M protein warrants further analysis. This may serve as a novel mechanism by which virus-encoded proteins counteract host IFN production.",
