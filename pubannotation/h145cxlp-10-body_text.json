    "text": "The minimum incidence of influenza-associated PICU admissions per 100,000 children <17 years of age was calculated for each season based on the observed number of influenza PICU patients with a residential address in Bavaria. To correct for non-participating PICUs, the estimates of the total number of PICU influenza cases treated in all eligible PICUs in Bavaria per season were derived taking into account the annual percentage of participating PICUs. The annual study population was used as denominator.",
