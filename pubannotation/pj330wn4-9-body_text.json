    "text": "To determine ciliary beat frequency, both the brain slices and the respiratory cells in culture were placed in an incubation (37°C) chamber and were observed via an inverted microscope system (Nikon TU1000, Kingstonupon-Thames, UK). Tissue was allowed to equilibrate for 30 minutes before readings. Beating cilia were recorded using a Motion Pro X4 digital high-speed video camera (Lake Image Systems, Henrietta, N.Y. USA) at a rate of 250 to 500 frames per second using an × 40 objective as previously described [18] . At least 512 or 1,024 frames were captured, respectively.",
