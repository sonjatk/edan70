In women, the distribution was 2.8%, 60.21%, 25.0%, and 12.1% and in men 0.76%, 43.1%, 41.8%, and 14.3%, respectively. The study participants were mainly of medium and high educational level, non-or ex-smokers, moderately affected by selected co-morbidities and they reported rather infrequent contact to small children.
