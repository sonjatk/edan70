    "text": "Interestingly, Huo et al. (2015) showed that knock-down of mammalian USP46 has a greater effect on reducing surface GluA1 (42% decrease) and mEPSC amplitude (32% decrease) than overexpression of USP46 (18%-20% increase in surface GluA1 and mEPSC amplitudes; Huo et al., 2015) . The more modest effects of USP46 overexpression are consistent with the low intrinsic catalytic activity of USP46 in the absence of WDR48 and WDR20 (Cohn et al., 2009; Faesen et al., 2011) . Intriguingly, Huo et al. (2015) also showed that mammalian USP46, but not USP12, was able to regulate GluA1 in neurons. It will be interesting to determine how USP46 and USP12 achieve substrate specificity in vivo given that they can both interact with WDR48 and WDR20.",
