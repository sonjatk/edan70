    "text": "TBEV is considered one of the most important arboviruses in central and eastern European countries and in Russia, with about 13,000 estimated human cases annually [24] . In fact, over the last decade there has been an approximately 300% increase in the number of TBE cases in Europe [25] , and TBEV is currently spreading into new regions in France, Sweden, Norway, and Italy [26] [27] [28] [29] . This increase is thought to be due to growth in population and spread of ticks, which is promoted by factors including climate change, social and political change, and changes in the land use [30, 31] . The increased expansion in Europe also poses an increased risk for the population engaged in outdoor activities.",
