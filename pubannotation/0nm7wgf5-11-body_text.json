    "text": "We identified three compounds, N-desmethylclozapine, fluoxetine hydrochloride, and salmeterol xinafoate, as dengue virus replication inhibitors in a DENV screening assay. All three inhibitors reduced dengue virus infection with IC 50 s in the high-nanomolar/low-micromolar range. Cells treated with these inhibitors had low levels of dsRNA and negative-strand intermediates. This finding, along with the time-of-addition and RNA transfection experiments, demonstrated that the inhibitors interfered with early stages of dengue virus RNA replication. The effect was specific to dengue virus, as the inhibitors did not have any effect on other related flaviviruses, such as JEV and WNV, or on respiratory syncytial virus, a negative-strand RNA virus, and rotavirus, a virus with a double-stranded RNA genome. Finally, we showed that treatment with all three inhibitors led to lysosome enlargement and autophagosome formation, possibly affecting endolysosomal pathways that are specifically involved in early stages of the DENV life cycle. Although a number of studies have characterized direct- acting antivirals targeting dengue virus proteins (14) (15) (16) (17) , many cellular factors have also been identified and proposed as targets for antiviral development (10, (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) . The two drugs identified in this study, N-desmethylclozapine and fluoxetine, regulate serotonin receptor signaling. However, a recent study demonstrated the inhibition of early stages of dengue virus replication by antagonists of dopamine receptor D4 but not serotonin receptor 2A (23) . Therefore, the inhibitory effect of N-desmethylclozapine and fluoxetine is unlikely to be due to their direct effect on serotonin receptor signaling. A previous report showed inhibition of autophagosome turnover and impairment of lysosomal fusion by clozapine in cortical neurons from rat (24) . Fluoxetine has been shown to induce the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and autophagy in certain cancer cell lines at 2-to 10-fold-higher concentrations than those used in our study (25, 26) . Treatment of J774 murine macrophages for 3 days with various concentrations of fluoxetine showed no cytotoxicity but inhibited Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth by 50 to 75% in a concentration-dependent manner, primarily by inducing autophagy via the induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-␣) (27) . The administration of fluoxetine also led to the induction of inflammatory cytokines in mouse frontal cortex (28) . Similarly to those observations, we show that in Huh-7 cells, under our treatment conditions, there is induction of autophagy but not ER stress. We have not measured levels of inflammatory cytokines secreted after treatment with the inhibitors in our study. It is unlikely that inflammatory mediators would specifically alter DENV infection without affecting many other RNA viruses tested in our study. We speculate that the in- hibitors identified in our study target pathways involved in endolysosomal biogenesis, thus affecting the fusion of internalized dengue virus virions with late endosomal membranes, or that the inhibitors target host factors that are required for dengue virus uncoating and/or the initiation of genome replication. Previous studies have shown that both RSV and RV induced autophagy at later stages of infection (29, 30) . RSV infection of dendritic cells induced autophagy, which was shown to be essential for the production of innate cytokines such as alpha interferon (IFN-␣), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-12p40, and TNF-␣ (31). Abrogating the autophagic pathway negatively affects rotavirus titers (32) , suggesting that while autophagy may restrict viral replication by the induction of innate immune responses in some cases, it may also be hijacked by some family of viruses, as it provides replication advantages. The role of autophagy in the life cycle of flaviviruses such as JEV and WNV has been controversial (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) . In the case of DENV, a recent report demonstrated differential regulation of the autophagy pathway by DENV during the course of infection. Autophagy was shown to support DENV replication at early stages but to play an antiviral role at later stages, as DENV suppressed this pathway during later stages of infection (39) . We did not observe an induction of autophagy under our infection conditions, most probably due to this suppressive effect. Singleparticle-tracking studies have shown that DENV colocalizes with autophagosomes after endocytosis and undergoes fusion in late endosomes (40, 41) . We speculate that treatment with N-desmethylclozapine, fluoxetine, and salmeterol leads to an alteration in autophagosome/lysosome biogenesis affecting early stages of the DENV life cycle. This observation also hints at differences in the pathways used by related flaviviruses at early stages of infection.",
