    "text": "To determine which input structures are good to use when G big is not known, we compare two different options. Since HFold (HFold-PKonly and Iterative HFold) cannot accept pseudoknotted input structures we use the following methods to produce pseudoknot-free input structures to HFold (HFold-PKonly and Iterative HFold). First, we use HotKnots hotspots [36] , i.e., the 20 lowest energy pseudoknot-free stems produced in the first phase of HotKnots. We choose the lowest free energy structure predicted by each of our methods as their final prediction given these hotspots. Second, we use SimFold's MFE structure [63] where the energy parameters of SimFold are changed to match that of HotKnots V2.0.",
