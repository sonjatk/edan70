    "text": "The complete network has assortativity coefficients close to zero, meaning there is not a tendency for similar nodes to connect to or avoid each other. This holds true within the GSCC for all node sampling schemes (electronic supplementary material, figure S4 ). Similar behaviour is observed for the mean local clustering coefficient, which is small and does not change appreciably. The network diameter is 24-TNS and SBS preserve this relatively small diameter well within the GSCC, but for small sample sizes the diameter increases under the RNS scheme. Plots for assortativity, clustering and diameter are shown in electronic supplementary material, figure S4. ",
