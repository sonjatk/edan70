    "text": "The confidence intervals for HFold and Iterative HFold with HotKnots hotspots are (73.35%, 83.53%) and (72.83%, 83.37%), respectively, and on pseudoknot-free structures they are (75.53%, 80.79%) and (74.93%, 80.26%) respectively. Again, based on the result of the permutation test, the difference in the results of HFold and Iterative HFold on pseudoknotted and pseudoknot-free structures are not significant. Similarly, the permutation test shows that the difference in prediction accuracy of HFold and Iterative HFold on SimFold input is not significant.",
