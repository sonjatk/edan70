    "text": "The most compute-intensive parts of each workflow (i.e. ProtDist in Figure 1 , ProtPars in Figure 2 , and ProtML in Figure 3 ) are executed in a distributed computing environment by simply multiplexing the data and using several instances of the respective programs. Figures 4 and 5 show execution times of the workflows for varying numbers of processors and sequences. In summary it can be seen that the system can achieve linear speedups.",
