    "text": "Research networks exist, in part, to facilitate the transfer of knowledge between members, so as to benefit the activities of individual members and the network as a whole [21, 151] . By establishing a common database and data collection standards, networks make it easier for their members to engage in collaborative projects and to leverage additional resources that may be useful in one's research. Members are encouraged to share data with others in the network but are also allowed the option to withhold certain information as deemed necessary. An important consideration, therefore, when creating a database is to develop data sharing agreements between network members. A good example of this is the EIDITH web-based database developed to collate and curate data for the USAID PREDICT project that operates in â‰ˆ30 countries around the world [152] . Such databases are only successful if network participants contribute in a trusting manner. Willingness to share data may be facilitated by individual or country-level security settings that enable restricted access to particular data or datasets, thereby alleviating national concerns about the sharing of potentially sensitive information.",
