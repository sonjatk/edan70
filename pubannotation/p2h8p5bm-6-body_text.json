    "text": "TBEV is a zoonotic disease and the natural cycle of TBEV is dependent and maintained in a complex cycle involving ticks as the vector and reservoir of the virus and small rodents as hosts for ticks [32] . Humans are not part of the natural transmission cycle of TBEV and are the incidental host when infected by a bite from an infected tick [33] . Transmission through consumption of unpasteurized milk has also been reported for TBEV [34, 35] , as well as transmission via solid organ transplant [36] .",
