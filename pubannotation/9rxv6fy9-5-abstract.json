    "text": "The earlier studies on the germicidal efficacy of far UVC light 13,15-18 were performed exposing bacteria irradiated on a surface or in suspension. In that a major pathway for the spread of influenza A is aerosol transmission 3 , we investigate for the first time the efficacy of far-UVC 222-nm light for inactivating airborne viruses carried by aerosols -with the goal of providing a potentially safe alternative to conventional 254-nm germicidal lamps to inactivate airborne microbes.",
