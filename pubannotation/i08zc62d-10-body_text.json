    "text": "The sialidase inhibitory assay was performed as reported previously Cho et al., 2013) . Briefly, 15 ml GH33 sialidase solution (0.1 U ml Ã€1 ) was pre-mixed with 15 ml sample solution at different concentrations in 510 ml 50 mM sodium acetate buffer pH 5.0 in a cuvette. 60 ml 0.125 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl--d-N-acetylneuraminic acid sodium salt hydrate (Sigma, catalogue No. M8639) in buffer at pH 5.0 was then added to the mixture as a substrate to start the reaction at 310 K. 4-Methylumbelliferone was immediately quantified by fluorometric determination with a SpectraMax M 2e Multimode Reader (Molecular Devices, USA). The excitation wavelength was 365 nm and the emission wavelength was 450 nm. Enzyme activity was recorded over a range of pre-incubation times (Fig. 1a) or concentrations (Fig. 1b) . The data were analyzed using a nonlinear regression program (SigmaPlot; SPCC Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). The experimental enzyme activity was determined using the logistic curve represented by (1), based on a time-driven protocol with initial velocity,",
