    "text": "â€¢ I do not understand why the source control scenario (scenario 3) did not also include an element of ventilation optimization. The start of the section describing the scenarios suggests that ventilation optimization would be \"complemented\" first by filtration and then by source control (page 9). This suggests that a ventilation optimization component would appear in all scenarios. Choosing just one \"optimal\" ventilation rate makes it difficult to ascertain the relative benefits due to ventilation and source control.",
