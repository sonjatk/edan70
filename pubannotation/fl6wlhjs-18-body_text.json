    "text": "We now propose a simple stochastic model for an inhalational anthrax outbreak, based on the work of Buckeridge, et al. and Brookmeyer et al. [16, 17] . As proposed by these authors, our model incorporates two elements: Any inhalational anthrax outbreak starts with the dispersion of the anthrax spores. Once spores are inhaled by a subject, in the incubation stage spores either germinate or are cleared out the lung. For the spores that germinate during incubation, the later stages of the disease are the prodromal and fulminant stages, followed by death. Buckeridge, et al. [16] model the spread of spores over a grid covering the Norfolk, Virginia region using a Gaussian plume model. Their model considers the source and Time series plots strength of the anthrax attack, along with prevalent wind directions.",
