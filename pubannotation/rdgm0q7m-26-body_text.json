    "text": "The geometry and stoichiometry of the nsp1␤-PCBP complex on the PRRSV mRNA is uncertain and difficult to predict. Nsp1␤ exists as a dimer in solution (32) , PCBPs have been shown to be capable of homo-and heteromultimerization and RNA binding by PCBPs could reflect interaction with single or multiple KH domains (42) (43) (44) . Binding assays with optimized RNA targets generated by in vitro SELEX have revealed that a tandem array of three C-patches maximizes PCBP2 binding to its RNA target (45) and several established PCBP binding sites contain three or more C-patches (33, 46) . However, the sequence motifs implicated in PCBP binding from gene expression analysis of human cells (47, 48) and Caenorhabditis elegans (49) comprise predominantly two adjacent C-rich patches, although it is not known how strongly PCBPs bind to these targets, nor whether any other cellular proteins participate in the interactions. The EMSA data presented here reveal that alone, PCBP1 and PCBP2 bind weakly to the PRRSV C-rich region (which has two C-patches), requiring nsp1␤ for stable binding. Similarly, nsp1␤ binds RNA very weakly, but is evident in complexes (with PCBPs) from supershift assays. Stable complex formation on the mRNA thus likely depends upon conformational changes in one or both molecular partners and potentially, direct contact between nsp1␤ and mRNA. In support of the latter, we found that amino acid substitutions in the putative RBM) of nsp1␤ greatly weakened the association of the complex with RNA, without apparent effect on the interaction with PCBP2. Yeast two-hybrid studies (35) have shown that the reciprocal interaction of nsp1␤ and PCBP2 requires the C-terminus of nsp1␤, including the protease domain (PLP1␤) and Cterminal extension, and the KH2 domain of PCBP2. In light of this, we hypothesize that the association of nsp1␤ with KH2 would not preclude binding of nsp1␤ to RNA. An alternative interpretation is that nsp1␤ RBM fails to induce a conformational change in PCBPs necessary for stable RNA association.",
