    "text": "The iLIR@viral database is a web resource freely available to the academic community at http://ilir.uk/virus/. Various functionalities are accessible under specific menus. The 'Classification' menu gives access to the complete list of putative LIR motifs in viral proteins. Two virus taxonomic systems have been used: the nomenclature used by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) to name the species, genus and families of each of the viruses cited in the database, and the Baltimore classification system that groups viruses depending on their genome and kind of replication (dsDNA, dsRNA, ssDNA, ssRNA and reverse-transcribing viruses) (see Methods). 63, 64 For each specific family or group of viruses, the data are presented in a table containing (i) the clickable UniProtKB accession number of the protein, (ii) the information related to the LIR-motif (position, sequence, PSSM score, if the pattern is recognized as an xLIR or WxxL motif and the presence of the motif in an intrinsically disordered region (ANCHOR)), (iii) the name of the protein and (iv) the name of the species. For some genera, no putative LIR-containing protein (LIRCP) could be identified; for accuracy in the classification, these are listed but appear in red (Fig. 1) .",
