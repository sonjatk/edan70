    "text": "Previous genetic studies examining the history of the influenza virus have performed extensive phylogenetic analyses of influenza genomes [8, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . They have shown considerable nucleotide diversity among circulating strains, given clear evidence for adaptive selection of antigenic variants [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] , and have shown that most of the major innovations within the flu genome have occurred via reassortment [5] , by which one flu strain has recombined with another strain and obtained a segment of RNA from the second strain.",
