    "text": "Bacterial pneumonia is primarily caused by the commensal bacteria normally residing in the URT [11, 12] . The most common causes of bacterial pneumonia for children <5 years of age are Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus [11] although this varies over time and space. From a rudimentary ecological perspective, the human respiratory tract can be defined as an ecosystem with two distinct niches: the URT, characterized by regular asymptomatic carriage of commensal bacteria, and the LRT, which is inhabited at a low abundance by bacteria in healthy individuals [13] . During the first year after birth, the nasopharynx is rapidly colonized [14] and URT carriage is established via ongoing synergistic and antagonistic interactions among commensal bacteria [15] . Although pneumonia is an infection of the lungs, microbial selection in the URT may play an important role in etiology as bacterial strains in the URT can be readily aspirated into the LRT. For example, URT carriage is believed to be a necessary precursor of pneumonia due to S. pneumoniae [16, 17] .",
