    "text": "As for the ex vitro plant, the plant parts were dried in oven at 50 ∘ C until a constant weight was achieved and then were ground. The powdered plants were then extracted by sonication for 10 min at room temperature of 25 ± 2 ∘ C using methanol as the solvent (plant materials-solvent ratio of 1 : 5 to 1 : 10). After filtration, the filtrates were dried using a rotary evaporator (Buchi, Switzerland) at 40 ∘ C to obtain the respective extracts. The extracts were then kept in freezer at −20 ∘ C prior to analysis. Meanwhile, for in vitro plants, dried callus was then powdered using a mortar and pestle and extracted by sonication method as described above.",
