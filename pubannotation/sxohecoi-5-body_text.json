    "text": "Antibody in genital tract secretions of HIV-1-infected individuals could play a role in facilitating the transport of virus across mucosal epithelia. Such a role is made particularly plausible by the reported expression of the Fc neonatal receptor (FcRn) in human genital mucosal tissue [19] . FcRn is a heterodimeric receptor belonging to the MHC class I family of proteins [20, 21] . The expression of FcRn in endothelial cells is thought to be critical for IgG homeostasis in blood [22] , and its expression in placental syncytiotrophoblasts is a key factor in transporting maternal IgG to the fetal circulation [23] . A characteristic of FcRn is its ability to bind the Fc region of IgG at acidic pH and to release it at neutral pH [24] . This pH-dependent binding allows the transport of intact IgG or of IgG immune complexes from luminal surfaces bathed in acidic fluids, for example, cervicovaginal secretions, to basolateral surfaces exposed to a neutral intracellular milieu [19] .",
