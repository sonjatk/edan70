    "text": "The Relationship between R 0 and Initial Epidemic Growth Rate During the early phase of an epidemic, the observed exponential growth rate, k, is related to the basic reproduc-tive ratio, R 0 , of the infection. Mathematically, k is just the dominant eigenvalue of the disease-free equilibrium, and one can show that k must satisfy",
