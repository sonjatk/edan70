    "text": "We have used the new Quascade system to implement distributed workflows for comparative phyloinformatics using different algorithms. Figures 1, 2 , and 3 show these workflows for distance-based algorithms, maximum parsimony algorithms and maximum likelihood algorithms, respectively. The workflows use ClustalW [10] to compute multiple sequence alignments and different phylogenetic algorithms from the PHYLIP package [4] .",
