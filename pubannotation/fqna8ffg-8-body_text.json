    "text": "Therefore, in this study, we aimed to identify the pulmonary cell type, which initiates the inflammation and produces the neutrophil chemoattractants upon CNP exposure. Since the majority of inhaled nanoparticles are rapidly incorporated by AM, thereby posing the highest cellular dose to these cells, and since activated macrophages are in general well known for their extreme cytokine production capability, we hypothesize that alveolar macrophages play a key role for the initiation of CNP induced lung inflammation. In order to address this question, we performed a time course analysis to identify the onset of the inflammatory response, isolated AM by Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), CD45+ lung tissue leukocytes and CD45-lung epithelial cells from the CNP instilled mice and examined the expression of inflammatory genes and neutrophil chemoattractants. Much to our surprise however, a comparison of the gene expression profiles of the three isolated cell populations uncovered an essential role of the alveolar epithelium, most likely type II (ATII) cells, for the production of the neutrophil chemoattractant at the onset of CNP induced inflammation, but not for the particle laden AM. Also no activation of alveolar macrophages preceding the cellular inflammation could be detected during the first 3 to 12 h after exposure.",
