    "text": "It is well established that patients with an acute asthma exacerbation are at high risk for future episodes [2] . This specific patient group should receive appropriate controller therapy, but leaning on following outpatients' visits has been demonstrated not to be reliable, as shown by a study on 3435 ED visits for asthma in children, only 18% of whom had a prescription for inhaled corticosteroids in the 2 months following the ED visit, only 12% attended follow-up appointments, and only 5.2% received both [25] . Even if the guidelines do not state that ED physicians should identify children with persistent asthma and start long-term therapy, some authors suggest that, in appropriate patients, inhaled corticosteroids might be prescribed at ED discharge [24, 26] ; however, the rates of such prescriptions are low [25, 26] .",
