    "text": "To characterize the MERS-CoV M protein in terms of its IFN antagonism, M protein was ectopically expressed in cultured cells for functional assays ( Figure 1A) . A luciferase reporter construct driven by IFN-β promoter was used to reflect IFN-β promoter activity stimulated during infection. Sendai virus was used as a model virus to potently induce IFN expression in transfected cells. When increasing doses of M proteins were expressed in advance, a dose-dependent inhibition of IFN-β promoter activity was observed ( Figure 1B ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2). A similar observation was also noted when synthetic dsRNA analog poly(I:C) was used as an alternative inducer that specifically stimulates the RLR pathway of IFN production ( Figure 1C ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2). These two pieces of data are generally consistent with a previous report, 22 and they further strengthen the current model of the IFN antagonism of MERS-CoV M protein.",
