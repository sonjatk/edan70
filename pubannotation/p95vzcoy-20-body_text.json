    "text": "The presence of the negative-sense strand of DWV, as indicated by a band at 221 bp of the agarose gel electrophoresis [49, 52] was confirmed for all colonies of T1 at week 13, but only for two colonies at week 16 ( Figure 2) . Similarly, the band at 221 bp was clearly visible in all but one colony of T2 at the first sampling point. Four weeks later, the band was still well visible in one colony, less pronounced in two others, and not visible in three colonies. ",
