    "text": "In this study, we used a systems-genetics approach to conduct complex trait analysis and uncover gene networks in the pulmonary myocardium in situ (Chesler et al. 2005; Sieberts and Schadt 2007) . Systems-genetics approaches use genetic reference populations such as the BXD resource, a set of recombinant inbred mice which are the progeny of an intercross between the two parental mouse strains C57BL/6J and DBA/2J (Andreux et al. 2012; Peirce et al. 2004) . Recombinant inbred strains like the BXD and the Collaborative Cross (Ram et al. 2014; Threadgill et al. 2011 ) are especially suited for systems-genetics studies because each strain is effectively immortal (Andreux et al. 2012) . They provide a powerful test bed for linking genetic loci to variation, including mapping loci controlling gene expression levels. Such loci are termed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) (Chesler et al. 2005) . Importantly, analyses of eQTL provide a means for detecting specific regulators of a gene of interest as well as identification of networks of coregulated transcripts (Andreux et al. 2012; Hall et al. 2014) .",
