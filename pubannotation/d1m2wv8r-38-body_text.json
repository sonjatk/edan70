    "text": "The network analysis of the DEPs was performed by the \"Analyze Network Algorithm\" provided by Metacore TM software. The pathway analysis of the DEPs was performed using the GeneGo pathway maps in the Metacore TM database (version 6.24; build 67895, Thomson Reuters). In addition, the Pathway Maps tool was used for pathway enrichment evaluation, in which the p-values were calculated based on the hypergeometric distribution with the default background database.",
