    "text": "The interest in coronaviruses was reignited after the 2002 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 2012 outbreak of MERS-CoV. Researchers have tried to understand pandemic potential of MERS-CoV by studying its emergence and ecology. Studies are being carrying out to assess how this virus causes disease so that novel therapeutics and vaccines can be developed. The mode of transmission of MERS-CoV is yet to be established, but it is assumed to have come from bats [13] . Camels found in the Arabian Peninsula may serve as intermediate hosts for human infection [14] . This review will focus on studies trying to elucidate mechanisms by which MERS-CoV escapes host-immune system and causes disease. We will also examine the recent advances in the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines. Figure 1 vitro studies. Studies were conducted on animal models and human lung cell lines, and the account from a single autopsy [43] . In vitro studies revealed that MERS-CoV can easily replicate in several cultured human cells, as well as, in the differentiated and nondifferentiated human epithelial cells [34, 44] . The antigens of MERS-CoV were found on the macrophages in the alveoli of the infected human lung explants, ciliated and nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells, endothelial cells and pneumocytes [33, 45] . These findings were in sync with the findings made in the single autopsy where MERS-CoV antigen was detected on pneumocytes, endothelial cells and epithelial cells of the airways and few on macrophages [43, 45] . Macrophages are the important phagocytic cells of innate immune system which help remove the pathogenic substances from the body and present their antigens to the T cells. The cytokines as well as chemokines produced by the macrophages help in destroying the pathogens, adjusting the immune system and maintaining tissue homoeostasis [46] . However, in MERS, the virus-infected macrophages contribute considerably to the development of disease symptoms [47] . The infection with MERS-CoV of human epithelial cells induces the release of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines from the monocyte-derived macrophages. It is believed that these chemokines/cytokines cause inflammatory changes and tissue injury through infiltration of immune cells in the lower respiratory tract [47] . The patients suffering from MERS clinically manifest pneumonia, which is progressive in nature and has a large number of macrophages and neutrophils found in the fluids present in the lungs [3, 48] . Studies conducted on rhesus macaques have shown the lung tissue infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils on MERS-CoV infection, though their respiratory symptoms were milder as compared with humans [49] . Many scientists believe that this sequestration of immune cells contribute to the development of lymphopenia seen in patients with MERS. The progress in the severity of pneumonia and respiratory dysfunction in the MERS patients is also attributed to cytokine/chemokine induction [30, 50] . Zhou et al. found that MERS-CoV can efficiently replicate inside macrophages and, hence, can overcome the host immune system. [47] . Thus, these phagocytes act like reservoirs and means of transportation for these viruses, helping to replicate and disseminate, such as the HIV virus [51] .",
