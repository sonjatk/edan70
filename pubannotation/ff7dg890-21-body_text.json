    "text": "We may obtain an estimate for R 0 by calculating the initial growth rate (k) of an infection from data and equating it to the growth rate of the equations, calculated from the dominant eigenvalue of the disease-free equilibrium (see Methods). Such an exercise reveals that for any observed k, the precise value of R 0 estimated is crucially dependent on the fundamental assumptions made concerning the distributions of latent and infectious periods. Specifically, we find that the following equation determines the relationship between R 0 and an empirically estimated epidemic growth rate, k:",
