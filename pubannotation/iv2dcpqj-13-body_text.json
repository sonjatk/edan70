    "text": "Viruses 2015, 7 7 were generated and transduced into PK-15 cells, resulting in efficient knockdown of the eEF1A expression ( Figure 4A ). Twenty-four hours after lentivirus-mediated shRNAs transduction, PK-15 cells were infected with the CSFV Shimen strain at an MOI of 0.1. The viral replication was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, virus titration and Western blotting. In comparison with the shNC control, the viral genome copies in the eEF1A-knocked down cells were increased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 4A ). Similarly, the CSFV titers were significantly increased after eEF1A knockdown in PK-15 cells ( Figure 4B ), and the N pro protein expression in the sheEF1A-transduced cells was increased at 48 and 72 hpi ( Figure 4C ). The results indicate that the eEF1A negatively modulates the CSFV replication. ",
