    "text": "Best multiplex primer and probe panels were derived from AlleleID® (Table 1 ; see Online Resource S7, Fig. S7 .1 for positions on control/target genes); secondary structures (hairpins, homo-and hetero-dimerization) of primers, probes and templates were assessed within the software used. All undesirable secondary structures had a delta G (ΔG) >−2 and melting temperature (T m ) at least 30°C less than the chosen T a . These suggested inhibitory secondary structures at the reaction temperature were highly unlikely to form and thus have little detrimental effect on the desired PCR reaction. PCR product sequences were confirmed to be the same as predicted target sequences (Online Resource S7, Fig. S7.2-7.7) . Brief comparisons between SYBR® green and hydrolysis probe methods demonstrated that both chemistries yielded comparable values of C p . Moreover, completing the assays as either duplexes or triplexes had little impact on C p values. (A summary of these results is provided in the Online Resource S8, Fig. S8 .1). Optimal primer/probe concentrations varied between 200 and 400 nm for uniplex reactions (Table 1) . While satisfactory efficiencies (i.e. E >90 % but <110 %) with duplex reactions were achieved using the same primer/probe concentrations as for uniplex reactions (see Online Resource S8, Fig. S8 .2-3 for standard curves), triplex reactions required primers and probes to be of equal concentration (200 nM; as per the manufacturer's recommendation) to achieve reaction efficiencies comparable to those recorded in duplex reactions (Fig. 1) . All assays had maximised amplification over a 5-10°C range in T a , with a T a of 60°C acceptable for all assays (Table 1) . A total of 200 ng of total DNA per reaction provided the best compromise between obtaining a low C p value and maintaining assay sensitivity for both multiplexes.",
