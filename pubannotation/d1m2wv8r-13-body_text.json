    "text": "Proteins involved in the stimulus-response and regulation of apoptosis were enriched by Gene Cluster 3.0 and DAVID software. As shown in Fig. 4a , hierarchical clustering of the Felis catus proteins was generated using the DEPs listed in Supplementary Table S1. The analysis revealed that all replicates clustered tightly. Interestingly, the DAVID software analysis showed that most proteins in a given cluster were enriched for functions involved in similar biological processes.",
