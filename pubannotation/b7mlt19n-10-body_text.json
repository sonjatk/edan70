    "text": "The LIR motifs can be divided into 3 subtypes depending on the residue at the first position: W-, F-and Y-types. 8 It has been shown that the F-type LIR motif of mammalian ULK1 and ATG13 has a preference for GABARAP proteins, thus suggesting that the subtype of the LIR motifs could be related to a specificity toward Atg8family proteins. 7 Additionally F-type and Y-type LIR motifs are mostly contained in selective autophagy adaptor proteins. 8 We thus analyzed the distribution of W-, F-and Y-type of WxxL and xLIR patterns at the viral order and family levels (Table S4 and Fig. 2C, D) . We observed that 45% and 38% of the putative LIR motifs matching the WxxL pattern are of F-type and Y-type respectively. W-type motifs are the least represented, with about 17% of the patterns (Fig. 2C) . Similar distribution could be observed for the putative xLIR motifs with a higher variability across families, probably due to the low representation of xLIR motifs compared with WxxL patterns (Fig. 2D) .",
