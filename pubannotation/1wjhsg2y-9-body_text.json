    "text": "A regional network approach can enhance both bat conservation and zoonotic disease mitigation efforts. For instance, longitudinal studies of regional bat populations will aid in identifying shared threats to bats and human-mediated factors associated with increased disease emergence risk, both of which will likely change over time. Yet few bat research networks actively incorporate capacity building and hands-on-training in disease surveillance; however, the Red Latinoamericana para la Conservación de los Murciélagos (RELCOM) identifies emerging diseases as a conservation priority [79] and the Southeast Asian Bat Conservation Unit (SEABCRU) provides protocols on personal protective equipment and safety when conducting bat disease surveillance [80] . The Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats (EUROBATS) is the only regional bat network to convene a multidisciplinary workshop of public health officials, bat experts, and veterinarians to coordinate otherwise disjunct surveillance efforts for European bat lyssaviruses (EBLV) in several European countries [81] . This workshop laid the foundation for the Resolution on Bats and Rabies in Europe and development of standardized protocols for EBLV surveillance programs in all European countries. Taken together, collaboration is required among diverse experts, including bat conservationists, public health officials, and virologists, in order to build impactful One Health research agendas and formulate effective recommendations to mitigate shared regional threats to bat populations and human health.",
