    "text": "The major weakness of our study is its retrospective character and the absence of an age-matched control group. However, reports, from prospective conducted studies without profound characterisation of the isolates, describing association between wheezing and bacterial infection support our findings [10, 19, 22] . The absence of a control group is considered a minor weakness, as previous publications have demonstrated the limited risk for contamination of BAL when technical precautions are taken [13, 20, 26, 27] . Moreover, performance of FOB + BAL is considered unethical in healthy children [10, 12] .",
