    "text": "The differential inhibition of the viruses tested by the same supernatants is reflected by the distinct viral inhibition ratios observed ( Figure 5B -E and Table 1 ). Sensitivity of each virus to rfeIFNÎ± correlated with sensitivity to the Sup 2216 and induction of Mx in target cells by the supernatants highly correlated with the inhibition of all viruses ( Figure 5F-I) . Finally, Sup 2216 derived from PBMCs of cats c08, whose cells had indicated strong responsiveness to stimulation with ODN 2216 in previous experiments, most efficiently inhibited the replication of all viruses.",
