    "text": "In this work, a multiphase numerical model based on the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach was adopted, which has been widely employed in aerosol dynamics simulation in enclosed environments [17, [22] [23] [24] . In this approach, the governing equations of the carrier phase were numerically solved in the computational geometry based on the Eulerian framework [23] . Transient species transport model for water vapor was added to the Eulerian carrier phase models to represent the humidity in the air [23] . For the discrete phase, the governing equations were described in the Lagrangian framework. Each aerosol released from the injections point was tracked individually in the Lagrangian frame for its instantaneous position and velocity.",
