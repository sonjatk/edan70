    "text": "To test the hypothesis that inflammatory cytokines were responsible for liver pathogenesis in CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice, we administered transgenic mouse serum intravenously into nontransgenic mice. We observed the development of chronic hepatitis in the nontransgenic mice within 7 days after the serum transfer ( Figures 6B and C) . This finding was consistent with the 28 days after immunization with LC16m8 or rVV-N25. The scale bars indicate 100 mm (C) and 50 mm (D). (E) Histological evaluation of steatosis in liver samples from CD4-depleted or CD8-depleted CN2-29 (+/2) /MxCre (+/2) mice 28 days after immunization with LC16m8 or rVV-N25. Significant relationships are indicated by a P-value. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0051656.g004 hypothesis that inflammatory mediators played a key role in inducing hepatitis. Furthermore, to investigate whether TNF-a and IL-6 played particularly critical roles in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis in the transgenic mice, we neutralized TNF-a and blocked the IL-6 receptor in the livers of these mice. As expected, chronic hepatitis did not develop in these mice. (Figure 6D and E) .",
