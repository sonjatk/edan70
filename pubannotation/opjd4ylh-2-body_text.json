    "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of illness and death worldwide, especially in Asia and Africa. Despite the fact that TB is a curable illness, the tragedy is that TB poses a grave danger to healthcare workers including nurses because of their exposure to TB patients in health facilities. According to the World Health Organization [1] , TB remains the biggest killer in the world as a single pathogen, and the healthcare systems are being overwhelmed by the increasing number of TB cases.",
