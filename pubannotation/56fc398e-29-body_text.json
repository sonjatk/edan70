    "text": "For outbreaks seeded in Cumbria and simulated on the full dataset, we obtain a final mean epidemic size of 185 farms, with a mean duration of 22 weeks and a mean peak size of 45 farms (figure 2; electronic supplementary material, figure S8 ). The mean epidemic sizes after 6 and 12 weeks were 23 and 64 farms, respectively. For all node sampling methods without rescaling, the epidemic size is under-predicted as the percentage of nodes sampled decreases (figure 2). After six weeks, S min ¼ 3% for the TNS method, 20% for the SBS method and 80% for the RNS method. After 12 weeks, the percentage of nodes that must be sampled increases to 9%, 30% and 90% for the TNS, SBS and RNS methods, respectively (figure 2b). In order for these methods to accurately predict the full epidemic, 14%, 40% and 90% of the nodes must be sampled for the TNS, SBS and RNS methods, respectively (figure 2c). For the RMS method, S min ¼ 30% for 6 weeks, 50% for 12 weeks and 80% for the whole epidemic. Contour plots for epidemic size predictions for outbreaks seeded in Cumbria for each week of the outbreak (from week 1 to the end of the epidemic) are shown in electronic supplementary material, figures S8-S11. All methods provide accurate predictions of the size of the epidemic in the first few weeks. However, for longer durations, the TNS and the SBS methods provide the most robust predictions of epidemic size over time. Similar behaviour is observed for model predictions of epidemic duration and epidemic peak size (electronic supplementary material, figures S8-S11b,c)-the TNS method is able to accurately capture these characteristics when only 15% of the nodes are sampled, compared with 30%, 80% and 90% for the SBS, RMS and RNS methods, respectively.",
