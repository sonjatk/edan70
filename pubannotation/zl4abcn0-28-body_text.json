    "text": "Statistical analyses were conducted for the lycorine content in callus (initiated via 4.5 M 2,4-D alone, 9.00 M 2,4-D with combination of 4.5 M BAP) and H. littoralis wild plant part extracts. The investigation shows that lycorine production in initiated callus at 4.5 M 2,4-D alone and 9.00 M 2,4-D with 4.5 M BAP is not significantly different while there is significant difference when compared with wild plant extract ( > 0.05). This indicates that the callus formed from these 2 different plant growth regulators is having high amount of lycorine compared to wild type plant. Thus, for the upcoming study, this hormone combination could be a good start to initiate a callus from H. littoralis to obtain secondary metabolites. Hence, the present analytical method may be of value for routine quantification of lycorine in the callus culture production and standardization of the raw material or extracts of H. littoralis.",
