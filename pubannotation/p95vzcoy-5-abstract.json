    "text": "Here, we empirically test for the first time whether ants, Myrmica rubra, which are common in Europe [46] and an invasive species in North America [47], can be alternative hosts of DWV and if foodborne transmission is feasible. Monitoring of viral loads after consumption of virus-infected food will shed light on the fate of the viruses. If negative-sense strands of the RNA viruses can be found, this would suggest virus replication [48, 49] .",
