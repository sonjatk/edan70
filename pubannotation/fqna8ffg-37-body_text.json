    "text": "For gene expression profiling, lung tissues and BAL macrophages were prepared for total RNA isolation using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA concentrations were analyzed by Nanodrop system (PEQLAB Biotechnologie GMBH, Erlangen, Germany), and for RNA quality confirmation the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer chip system (Agilent Technologies, BÃ¶blingen, Germany) with the Agilent RNA 6000 Kit were used. cDNA synthesis was performed using the SuperscriptII system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR green ROX mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA), analyzed by the ABI Prism Sequence Determination System (Applied Biosystems, California, USA). Gene specific primers are listed in Table 1 and actin, beta (Actb) and hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (Hprt) transcripts were used as the housekeeping genes for the standardization of the relative mRNA expressions. The detailed procedure has been described by Yin et al. [73] .",
