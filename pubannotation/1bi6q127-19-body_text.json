    "text": "Arousal from hibernation is a stressful event for bats [55] . Many big brown bats are latently infected with a gammaherpesvirus [56] . Gerow et al. [57] demonstrated that the virus reactivates from latency when big brown bats arouse from hibernation, leading to detection of the virus in blood. This reactivation was also associated with a low level of antibodies against the virus. Following hibernation the antibody levels increase, which subsequently drives the virus into latency.",
