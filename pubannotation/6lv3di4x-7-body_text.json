    "text": "JEV induces poor innate immune responses in NEC. Following infection of airway epithelial cells by respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus type 1, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, several proinflammatory cytokines are induced, including interleukin-1␤ (IL-1␤), IL-6, IL-8, and interferon lambda 1 to 3 (IFN-s) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) . We therefore assessed the innate immune response following JEV infection of NEC. Only JEV Laos induced significant IL-6 gene expression at a late time point (72 hpi [Fig. 4A] ). Both JEV strains induced a significant induction of IL-8 mRNA at 48 and 72 hpi (Fig. 4B) . Nevertheless, at the protein levels no virus-induced IL-1␤, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was detected at any of the time points tested (data not shown). Interestingly, IL-8 secretion was enhanced at 72 hpi (P Յ 0.001) in JEV Laos-infected NEC (2,055 Ϯ 595 pg/ml) compared with those in the mock control (1,201 Ϯ 595 pg/ml) and JEV Nakayama (1,151 Ϯ 595 pg/ml) challenges (values are means Ϯ standard deviations [SD]) (Fig. 5) .",
