    "text": "â€¢ I found some parts of the description of the risk model confusing, in particular towards the bottom of page 7. Firstly, the text states that the models are based on a predefined population attributable burden of disease for each exposure and disease. Is this simply referring to the calculation described later in the section (bottom of page 8)? Secondly, the text then states that \"national estimates are then calculated from the national burden of disease data by scaling the attributable fraction according to the ratio of national versus European indoor concentration estimates for each pollutant\". I'm afraid I could not follow the point being made here. Which \"European\" estimates are being referred to?",
