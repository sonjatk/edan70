    "text": "We have demonstrated the utility of workflow systems by designing a pipeline that starts with data input by the biologist. Once the relevant data is uploaded into the workflow the remaining steps are all automated. In particular these steps comprise starting with multiple alignments of sequences to the distribution of the output to various algorithms, distributing the relevant outputs to different servers in a distributed environment which is grid compatible, and finally visualizing the output. Such a workflow system saves a significant amount of time and eliminates possible human errors in analyzing critical data.",
