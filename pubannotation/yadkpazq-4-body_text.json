    "text": "Distinct classes of ODN have been shown to induce differential immune responses [20] . Class A CpG ODN (CpG-A) consist of CpG motifs in a phosphodiester core, flanked on both ends by phosphorothioate poly (G) sequences. CpG ODN of this class are characterized by their potential to both induce massive type I IFN secretion by pDCs [12] and increase NK cytotoxicity [21] , rendering them ideal candidates as prophylactic enhancers of innate immunity to viral infections. Conversely, class B CpG ODN (CpG-B), which encode multiple CpG motifs on a phosphorothioate backbone, promote monocyte maturation and B cell activation, thus substantially supporting the development of humoral immune responses [22] [23] [24] . Both CpG-A and CpG-B have indicated immunostimulatory properties in immune cells of mice, primates and many domestic species in vitro [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] , while in vivo studies in outbred animals have mainly been carried out with CpG-B [24, 32, 33] . Concerning the cat, specifically synthesized CpG-A molecules were recently shown to induce IFNÎ³ [34] ; CpG-B molecules indicated the capability to induce proliferation of feline cells [35] , and CpG-B-adjuvanted allergen indicated potential for immunotherapy in a feline asthma model [36] . Although class C [37, 38] and class P ODN [39] were developed in more recent years in an effort to combine the advantageous effects of both CpG-A and CpG-B and increase immunogenicity, CpG-A remain the strongest inducers of type I IFN described to date.",
