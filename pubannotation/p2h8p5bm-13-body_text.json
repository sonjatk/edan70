    "text": "KFDV is only found in India (Figure 1 ), although a similar genetic variant, Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV) has been detected in Saudi Arabia [17, 47] . KFDV is mainly transmitted by ticks belonging to the genus Hemaphysalis but other tick genera have also been shown to be able to transmit KFDV [64, 65] . During hemorrhagic KFDV infection, the initial phase is similar to TBEV infection with fever and flu-like symptoms, but it may also include bleeding from the nose, mouth or gastrointestinal tract [65, 66] . The second phase, which is experienced by 1-20% of the cases, includes neurological symptoms such as headache, mental disturbance, and tremor, however, no evidence of meninges or encephalitis have been found [65] . There are about 400-500 reported annual cases of KFDV [47] , with case fatality rates ranging from 3 to 10% [17, 65] . In 1990 a KFDV vaccine was developed, although it provided some protection, due to low efficacy, the number of cases still increased from 1999 to 2012 [67] [68] [69] . Treatment of KFDV is limited to supportive care [47] .",
