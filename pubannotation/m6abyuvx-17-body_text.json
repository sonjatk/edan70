    "text": "Cytolytic cell activation can be measured using CD107a, a marker of degranulation [15] . The ratio of CD8 + CD107a + cells to all CD8 T cells significantly increased in rVV-N25-treated splenocytes after co-culture with EL-4CN2 or EL-4NS2 (P,0.05), whereas splenocytes that had been treated with any other rVV were not detected ( Figure 5A, B and C) . These results indicated that rVV-N25 treatment increased the frequency of HCV NS2specific activated CD8 T cells. Consistent with these results, the ratio of CD8 + IFN-c + cells to all CD8 T cells for rVV-N25-treated mice was also significantly higher than that for mice treated with any other rVV (P,0.05). Taken together, these findings indicated that rVV-N25 induced an effective CD8 T-cell immune response and that NS2 is an important epitope for CD8 T cells.",
