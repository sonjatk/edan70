    "text": "There were many reports suggesting a lack of awareness of AMR from the public. Many participants reiterated the fact that General Practitioners (GPs) may succumb to the pressure of demanding patients to prescribe antibiotics even when they were not clinically indicated. The next quote highlights how patients are \"always asking for antibiotics\": \"Patients will always come in and ask for antibiotics. So I think it's something that we should control and not say that it all is well and then we ignore it. But like I said ( . . . ) I think the awareness may not be strong enough for us to continue to pursue.\" -I01, Human Health It was also highlighted that there is a need for a firm drilling of infection prevention and control practices right in formative years of training for all healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals needed to be more aware of and prioritize infection control, as it is not currently under \"anyone's radar except for the people who do infection control\": \"As far as infection prevention goes, infection prevention and antimicrobial resistance is like stepchild of everyone. Because it's not in anyone's radar except for people who do infection control. So it's about making it a culture in everyone's mind, which is not an easy task.\" -I11, Human Health",
