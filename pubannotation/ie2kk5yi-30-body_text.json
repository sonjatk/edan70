    "text": "Bat forearm size, sex, and reproductive status were important predictors of Bartonella infection status, with odds of infection being higher in larger, male, and non-reproductive bats. While subadult status itself was not an important predictor of Bartonella infection, these findings could suggest higher risk in young male bats that are relatively large for their age. Our previous work has shown stronger innate immune defense (i.e., bacterial killing ability) in reproductive (mostly male) vampire bats, also suggesting greater susceptibility of non-reproductive hosts [49] . Similarly, subadults across a Mexican bat community also had higher odds of Bartonella infection [16] , and young male vampire bats play key roles in the long-distance dispersal of rabies virus [43] and display higher rates of rabies exposure, possibly owing to more direct contacts during the first year of life [75] . Larger forearm size could also relate to direct contact if larger bats are more dominant and aggressive, as found in other phyllostomid bat species [76] .",
