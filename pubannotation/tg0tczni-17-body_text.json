    "text": "In order to investigate the extent of codon usage bias in polioviruses, all RSCU values of different codon in 48 polioviruses strains were calculated. There is only two preferred codons UUG (Leu) and GUG (Val), choosing G at the third position, and most of preferred codons are ended with A ( Table 3) . The values of ENC among these polioviruses ORFs are similar, which vary from 52.609 to 55.105 with a mean value of 53.754 and S.D. of 0.545. The data showed that the extent of codon preference in polioviruses genes was kept basically stable.",
