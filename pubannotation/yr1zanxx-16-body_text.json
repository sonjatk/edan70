    "text": "To determine whether CSF1R antagonism impacts survival from WNV infection, mice were fed PLX5622-embedded chow for 2 weeks, then infected with WNV-NY [42] at either 10 2 or 10 4 PFU via footpad (f.p.) inoculation. Consistent with published data [8, 49] , 30% of control-treated mice survived infection with 10 4 PFU and 90% of control-treated mice survived infection with 10 2 PFU; however, mice treated with PLX5622 universally succumbed to infection with either inoculum titer (Fig. 2a) . This was associated with significantly increased weight loss (Fig. 2b ) and more severe clinical score (Fig. 2c, d) in PLX5622-treated compared with control-treated mice infected with 10 2 PFU WNV-NY.",
