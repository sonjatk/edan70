    "text": "Our phyloinformatics analysis with the core set has revealed a clear pattern: spatial clustering of the strains based on the particular geographical region rather than temporal clustering based on time scale or according to host range. The obtained trees for the medium-size data set are shown in the additional files 8, 9, and 10. The algorithms ProtPars, NJ, and UPGMA were used. All these algorithms have been distributed using the above Quascade workflows and deployed on a cluster of PCs. The utilized cluster consists of 16 nodes comprising 32 CPUs. Its detailed specification and architecture are shown in Table  1 and Figure 7 , respectively. However, the algorithms ML and Mr. Bayes could not be run on the existing system with the medium dataset since it became apparent that these algorithms require further optimization in terms of distribution and/or more processing resources.",
