    "text": "The inhibitory effect of some of the essential oils on the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines reported in this chapter seems to be mediated by suppressing gene expression of these cytokines. Such was described by some authors because they found that the essential oils studied significantly suppressed the protein and mRNA expression of the cytokines in stimulated cells, assuming therefore, that the inhibitory effect of these essential oils on the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines occurs mainly at transcriptional level [103, 116, 123, 124] . Thyme essential oil, mainly constituted by pcymene and thymol, only at high concentrations (5,000 mg/L) significantly inhibited total mRNA IL-1Î² expression in the mouse colon in which colitis was induced by TNBS, not inhibiting significantly IL-6 expression [125] .",
