    "text": "A partial hexon gene fragment was amplified by PCR to screen and type HAdV infection as previously described [16, 23] . The first-round PCR primers were AdTU7 (5 0 -GCCACCTTCTTCCCCATGGC-3 0 ) and AdTU4 0 (5 0 -GTAGCGTTGCCGGCCGAGAA-3 0 ) with 1004 bp PCR product; the second-round primers were AdnU-S 0 (5 0 -TTCCCCATGGCC-CACAACAC-3 0 ) and AdnU-A (5 0 -GCCTCGATGACGCCGCGGTG-3 0 ) with 956 bp PCR product. The PCR reactions contained 1.25 U FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase, 10× PCR Buffer with 2 mM MgCl 2 (Roche Diagnostic Systems Inc., Mannheim, Germany), 0.5 μM of each primer, 200 μM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate (i.e., dATP, dGTP, dCTP, dTTP; TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan), and 5 μL nucleic acids (first round) or 2 μL first-round PCR product (second round) as a template in a total volume of 25 μL. PCR conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 10 min, followed by 36 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 50°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 2 min. The final step was an extension at 72°C for 7 min. The second round of PCR was conducted using the same PCR conditions described above for the first round.",
