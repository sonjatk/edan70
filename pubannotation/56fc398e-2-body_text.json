    "text": "Modelling of infectious diseases is a rapidly growing field in which mathematical modellers can play a significant role in determining how applied knowledge can be translated into an understanding of dynamics at the population level [1] [2] [3] [4] . During the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in the UK in 2001, several research groups developed a range of models that were able to predict the spatio-temporal pattern of disease spread and the impact of control strategies [1, 3, 5] . The use of these models in 2001 highlighted the role that models could play in shaping policy. Since then, the infection data from the 2001 epidemic have enabled research to be carried out to predict optimal culling and vaccination strategies both for the 2001 epidemic itself and for any future FMD epidemic in the UK and elsewhere [6] [7] [8] [9] .",
