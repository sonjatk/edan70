    "text": "Among the 437 DEPs identified by method 2, the expression of 85, 102, 95, 209, and 225 proteins was significantly changed at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hpi, respectively (Fig. 2b) . As shown in Fig. 2b , only 3 of 437 proteins were identified at all five time points. Moreover, 22, 28, 27, 82 , and 86 DEPs were separately identified at the each of the five time points, respectively. These proteins were the key proteins used to study the biological processes at certain time points.",
