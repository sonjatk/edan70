    "text": "To differentiate rare variants from sequencing errors, methodologies were developed to measure and control for sequencing and PCR errors and described in Fig. S1 legend [17, 18] . Briefly, all mismatched read pairs in the ORPs were identified as sequencing errors and removed from analysis. Erroneous matching read pairs in the plasmid control were used to estimate the overall PCR error rate [17, 18] . Rates of these two types of errors were then combined in a position-dependent bionomial error model to make variant calls. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model. The tree with the highest log likelihood (-14363.5660) is shown. The percentage of trees in which the associated taxa clustered together is shown next to the branches. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained automatically as follows. When the number of common sites was ,100 or less than one fourth of the total number of sites, the maximum parsimony method was used; otherwise BIONJ method with MCL distance matrix was used. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The analysis involved 32 nucleotide sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There were a total of 9669 positions in the final dataset. Bootstrap values (percentage from 500 replications) are shown for the relevant nodes. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 [28] . Samples in Table S2 ).",
