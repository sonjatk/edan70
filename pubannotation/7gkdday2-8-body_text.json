    "text": "Viral nucleic acids were extracted from nasal swab specimens that had been collected in VTM using PureLink 1 Viral RNA/DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, CA, USA). The extracted nucleic acids were then subjected to single-plex reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) for detection of respiratory viruses including human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, human parainfluenza viruses type 1 to 3 (HPIV1, HPIV2, HPIV3), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenovirus, and human bocavirus (HBoV). The RT-qPCR was done using AgPath-ID™ One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and CFX96 Touch™ Real-Time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, CA, USA). The results of RT-qPCR were considered positive if an exponential fluorescence curve could cross the assigned threshold at C t <40.0. Previously published primers and probes were used for viral pathogen detection by RT-qPCR [12] [13] [14] [15] .",
