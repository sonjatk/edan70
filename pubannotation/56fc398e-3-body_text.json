    "text": "In the 2001 FMD outbreak, early dissemination of the disease, prior to the first detected case, was mainly a result of long-distance movement of livestock between farms and through markets [10] . In other countries where FMD is endemic, livestock movements are believed to play a significant role in disease persistence [11] . Movements of live animals are also thought to cause significant transmission of diseases such as bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in the UK [12, 13] , as well as vector-borne diseases such as trypanosomiasis in southeast Asia, Australasia and Africa [14, 15] , and Rift Valley fever in Africa [16] . In cases such as these, infected livestock may be moved prior to showing symptoms, and therefore there is a risk of long-distance spread occurring. It is therefore crucial to understand the risk of infection spread associated with livestock movements.",
