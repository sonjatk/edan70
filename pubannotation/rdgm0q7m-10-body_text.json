    "text": "WG in vitro translation reactions (30 l) were supplemented with 1 M nsp1␤, PCBP2 (or KH mutant derivative) or both proteins and programmed with mRNAs derived from AvaII-cut pPS0/PRRSV WT or pPS0/PRRSV CC2. Reactions were incubated at 18 • C for 5 min prior to addition of edeine to 5 M. Aliquots (1.5 l) were subsequently withdrawn at intervals post-edeine addition, mixed with an equal volume of 10mM EDTA, 100 g/ml RNase A and placed on ice. At the end of the time-course, samples were analysed by SDS-PAGE.",
