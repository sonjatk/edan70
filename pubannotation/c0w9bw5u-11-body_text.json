    "text": "To delineate the action point of the MERS-CoV M protein in IFN antagonism, we tested the ability of the M protein to inhibit the activation signal induced by different signal transducers of the RLR pathway individually. The activation signal will be mostly unaffected if the activation event mediated by that transducer is downstream of the action point where M protein exerts its inhibitory effect. As described above, RIG-I N is a constitutively active mutant that resembles (1 μL/mL) in C for 16 h before harvest for dual-luciferase reporter assay. Bars represent the mean of three biological replicates (n = 3) and error bars indicate their s.d. The statistical significance between selected samples was evaluated using a two-tailed Student's t-test for unpaired samples with equal variance and P-value (P) was indicated. Figure 3A ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2). A similar result was also obtained using MAVS as an activator ( Figure 3B ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2), which is a mitochondrial adapter that diverts the activation signal from RIG-I to the IRF3 and NF-κB pathways. [44] [45] [46] [47] When activators committed to the IRF3 pathway were used, greater inhibitory effects were observed, as in the cases of TBK1 ( Figure 3C ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2) and IKK-ε ( Figure 3D ; bars 3-5 compared with bar 2), which are kinases which recognize and phosphorylate IRF3 as direct substrate. [48] [49] [50] [51] Surprisingly, when a constitutively active mutant of IRF3 transcription factor (IRF3 5D), with five inducible phosphorylation sites at Ser/Thr residues mutated to Asp, 52 was employed, the expression of the M protein no longer quenched the IRF3-induced activation of IFN-β promoter ( Figure 3E ), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of M protein occurs upstream of IRF3 activation.",
