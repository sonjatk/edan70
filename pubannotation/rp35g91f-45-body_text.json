    "text": "Our eQTL analysis indicates that one of the genes potentially regulated by TTN is Rbm20, which in turn regulates Ttn isoform expression. RBM20 mediates alternative splicing of Ttn, resulting in increased expression of the shorter N2B isoform (increased stiffness) at the expense of the longer N2BA isoform (Beraldi et al. 2014; Guo et al. 2013; Wyles et al. 2016) . RBM20 is also involved in alternative splicing of Mef2a, Znf451, and Trdn (Beraldi et al. 2014; Guo et al. 2013) , and is associated with altered expression of Nkx2-5, Myl4, Myl7, Tnnt2, Mybpc3, and Actc1 (Beraldi et al. 2014) . These changes in gene expression could be due to alternative splicing of MEF2A, which is likely to regulate the pulmonary myocardium gene network (Table 4 ). In knockout/-down studies, loss of RBM20 is associated with altered splicing and expression levels of .200 genes, and the authors conclude that RBM20 underpins structural and functional development of cardiomyocytes (Beraldi et al. 2014) . RBM20 is also likely to be an important regulator of the pulmonary myocardium molecular phenotype, is associated with NKX2-5 expression, and could be an important therapeutic target in atrial fibrillation.",
