    "text": "For the first time, we have demonstrated that maternal H 2 administration improved MIA-induced neurological impairments of offspring, including short-term memory and social interaction at postnatal 3-5 weeks. Previously, we reported that maternal H 2 administration suppresses microglial activation in the same model. In the present study, H 2 also suppressed the activation of astrocytes, both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that H 2 exerts a protective role against MIA-induced neuroinflammation through the suppression of microglia and astrocytes. As a result, mature oligodendrocytes were restored and neurons were protected from damage, thus leading to improved long-term neurological outcomes following maternal H 2 administration. Prenatal exposure to LPS also resulted in a transient reduction in body weight of the offspring between P6 -P10, which was attenuated by maternal H 2 administration. This might be due to a change in the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis 35 . Deficient post-neonatal growth has been reported to contribute to poor neurologic outcome 36 , thus, the transient decrease of weight observed in this model might be related to the neurological impairments in the offspring.",
