    "text": "Based on the delayed expansion of endogenous SR CD4 + T cells coincident with onset of demyelination and rebound of Tregs in spinal cords during chronic infection (13) , we assessed the effect of Treg depletion during viral persistence. JHMV-infected DEREG mice (DTR + ) and their control littermates (DTR − ) were treated daily with DT at the peak of SR CD4 + T cell response between days 21 and 28 p.i. (13) . Foxp3 + Treg frequencies were 70% reduced at day 28 p.i. in both CLN and CNS of DTR + mice (Figures 1C,D) . By contrast, control DTR − treated mice revealed no alteration of Foxp3 + T cell frequencies in CLN and CNS after DT treatment (Figures 1C,D) . These results confirmed the specificity of DT-mediated Foxp3 + Treg depletion as well as their residual presence due to incomplete abrogation and rebound after ongoing DT treatment (23, 28) .",
