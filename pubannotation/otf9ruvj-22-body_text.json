    "text": "The duration of anti-infective treatment was significantly longer in the IVIG group than that in the control group (control, median 12 days; 2-40 days; IVIG, median 18 days; 3-65 days; t test, log-transformed data, p = 0.0096). Six patients in the control group and four patients in the IVIG group underwent anti-infective treatment before admission to the ICU. Excluding these patients, the duration of anti-infective therapy relative to LOS in the ICU was not significantly different between the groups (control median, 71% fraction of LOS ICU; IVIG, 79% of LOS ICU).",
