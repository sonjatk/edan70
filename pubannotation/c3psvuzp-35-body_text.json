Residues highlighted in yellow have evolved under positive selection with a posterior probability .0.95 (See Table  S4 ). The bottom line in each block indicates conservation across all species, with asterisks indicating identical residues and colons representing similar residues. (DOC) Alignment S2 Bat PARP4 largest exon. Regions in grey were removed from positive selection analyses due to low confidence in the alignment. Residues highlighted in yellow have evolved under positive selection with a posterior probability .0.95 (See Table  S5 ). The bottom line in each block indicates conservation across all species, with asterisks indicating identical residues and colons representing similar residues. Representative viral macrodomains were aligned to individual macrodomains from human macro-PARPs. Three motifs noted by Jankevicius et al. [16] to be critical for coordination of ADPr by macrodomains are boxed. Red residues match the conserved consensus sequences at these positions. Asterisks indicate the residues most important for catalytic removal of ADPr from a substrate protein. The lack of conservation of these residues in many of the macro-PARP domains suggests they may be able to bind, but not catalyze removal of, ADPr. (PDF) Figure S6 Phylogenetic tree of intact vertebrate PARP14 and PARP15 genes. PARP14 and PARP15 genes from vertebrates were aligned as described in Materials and Methods being careful to include only open-reading frames that were uninterrupted by frameshifts or stop codons. Some otherwise intact genes are omitted from the tree because one or more exons are missing due to assembly gaps. The maximum likelihood tree generated from these sequences is shown with bootstrap values indicated. We note that the position of marsupial PARP14-like sequences in this tree implies that the partial PARP14 duplication that gave rise to PARP15 occurred before the divergence of marsupials and placental mammals; however, we have seen no evidence for the presence of PARP15 in marsupial genomes, and the use of alternate phylogeny inference parameters places the PARP14-15 duplication after marsupial-placental mammal divergence. We therefore conservatively suggest that the PARP14-15 duplication occurred after marsupial-placental mammal divergence, rather than the less parsimonious possibility that the duplication occurred earlier and that PARP15 was subsequently lost in the marsupial ancestor. (PDF) Figure S7 Sliding window analyses of recently duplicated PARP14 paralogs. A sliding window dN/dS analysis (window size 150 codons, step size 50 codons) of PARP14 paralogs from microbat (A) and bushbaby (B) with the PARP14 domain structure indicated below. The grey horizontal line marks a dN/dS value of 1, indicating neutral evolution. The bushbaby genes fall in a gapped region of the genome assembly, resulting in a central region of the alignment being unreliable and therefore excluded from analysis. (PDF)",
