    "text": "We were also able to identify one xLIR motif in the sequence of the accessory viral protein Nef of the virus HIV-1 group M subtype B (strain 89.6). Nef colocalizes with LC3 and BECN1, and contributes to the inhibition of autophagic maturation, thus protecting the virus from elimination by autophagy. 61, 67 The proteins TRS1 from human cytomegalovirus and neurovirulence factor ICP34.5 from human herpesvirus (HSV) both interact with BECN1 via a specific BECN1-binding domain. This interaction is required for the inhibition of autophagosome maturation and fusion with the lysosomes. [68] [69] [70] 73 While iLIR could detect several WxxL motifs in TRS1 sequence, a single one in an intrinsically disordered region was identified for ICP34.5 whose sequence (64-RQWLHV-69) is quite well conserved among 4 strains of HSV-1 and one strain of HSV-2. However, to date, there is no evidence of association between ICP34.5 and LC3 proteins.",
