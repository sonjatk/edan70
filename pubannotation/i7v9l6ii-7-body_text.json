    "text": "Virus specific nucleic acid detection was performed using a multiplex kit from Beckman Coulter (Miami, USA) as described in detail 2 . This panel covered 11 different serotypes of Influenza virus and 11 viral serotypes among 6 viruses suspected to cause common upper respiratory tract infections (Supplementary Table S2 ). Target specific cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcriptase primer plex kit and for the GenomeLab GeXP start kit (Beckman Coulter). Reverse transcription (RT) reaction was performed in 20µL reaction volume using 12µL of extracted nucleic acid, 4µL of GeXP 5X RT buffer, 2µL of RT primer plex and 1µL each of undiluted Kan-r and reverse transcriptase enzyme. The reaction was initiated at 48 o C for 1 minute followed by 42 o C for 60 minutes and terminated at 95 o C for 5 minutes; the synthesised cDNA was kept at 4 o C before using for PCR analysis. PCR reaction was performed in 20µL reaction volume using 9.3µL of synthesized cDNA, 4µL 5X PCR buffer, 4µL, 25mM MgCl 2 , 2µL PCR primer plex and 0.7µL of Thermo Start DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific Inc. Fullerton, CA, USA). The PCR reaction was initiated at 95 o C for 5 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 94 o C for 30 seconds, 55 o C for 30 seconds and 70 o C for 1 minute. The PCR product was maintained at 4 o C prior to fragment analysis.",
