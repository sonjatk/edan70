    "text": "Platelet factor 4 is chemotactic for numerous cell types. It also functions as an inhibitor of hematopoiesis, angiogenesis and T-cell function, which may be used as a biomarker for establishing a prognosis in severe acute respiratory syndrome (18) . Changes in platelet morphology, with accompanying increases in megathrombocyte fraction, may occur in chronic liver diseases, and thrombocytes are activated in chronic liver diseases and liver cirrhosis. Platelet sensitivity to stimuli in patients with liver cirrhosis has been demonstrated to be higher than in healthy controls (19) and it was indicated that platelet factor 4 was activated and upregulated in chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. In the present study, levels of platelet factor 4 precursor decreased in the progression of hepatitis B to liver failure. This result suggests that further studies are required to investigate the potential of platelet factor 4 precursor as a biomarker in the progression of CHB.",
