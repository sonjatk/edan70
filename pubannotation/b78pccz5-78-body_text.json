    "text": "DALYs per year per a population of 1 million in EU-26, is significant. However, also substantial reductions have been proposed in the earlier work within the EU funded IAIAQ project [20] . The three alternative scenarios (and two additional source control scenarios) described earlier were tested to support policy development for controlling the risks and reducing the burden. The overall comparison of these scenarios in EU-26 is presented in Figure 4 . The achievable health benefits were 20% for the dilution scenario, 38% for the filtration scenario, and 44% for the indoor source control scenario (changing from 41% to 54% depending on assumed source reductions).
