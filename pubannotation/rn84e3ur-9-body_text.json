    "text": "Mazumdar et al. [8] CFD simple object model an airplane cabin dye/ tracer gas The movement of a crew member or a passenger could carry contaminants in its wake to as many rows as the person passed Wang and Chow [17] CFD three different moving human models an isolation room expiratory droplets Human walking disturbed the local velocity field, and the increase of walking speed could effectively reduce the overall number of suspended droplets Choi and Edwards [16] CFD a realistic walking human model a room compartment tracer gas (sulfur hexafluoride, SF 6 ) Faster walking speed resulted in less mass transport from the contaminated room into the clean room cabin is significantly different from the diffusion of gaseous contaminants [8, 18, 19] . The methods used for risk assessment of expiratory aerosols and gaseous contaminants are also different [20] . Until now, studies on the effects of human movement on aerosols transmission and infection risk distribution are still rare. In this work, the effects of human movement on respiratory infectious disease transmission are investigated. An in-flight outbreak case is used for investigation. A manikin with a detailed human profile is also used in the computational geometry. The Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is adopted to simulate the dispersion and deposition of the expiratory aerosols. The infection risks of the occupants are assessed by using quantitative risk analysis, and the influence of human movement on infectious disease transmission is also analyzed. Likelihood analysis is then performed as a hypothesis test on the input parameters and the different human movement pattern assumptions.",
