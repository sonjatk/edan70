    "text": "Early growth response factor-1 (Erg-1) is a transcription factor that plays a regulatory role in the expression of many important genes of inflammation (cytokine, cell adhesion molecules, and immunoreceptors). The human monocyte cell line THP-1 is often used as a model for tissue macrophages. Zhou et al. (2007) [149] showed that 1,8-cineole inhibited the Egr-1 synthesis and nuclear localization induced by LPS in THP-1 cells but did not affect the LPS-induced NF-κB expression in nuclei. Therefore, the authors concluded that 1,8-cineole may preferentially block the effect of Egr-1 by inhibiting the synthesis of Egr-1 and preventing Egr-1 nuclear internalization instead of NF-κB inhibition [149] . Some authors reported that α-pinene clearly inhibited the translocation of NF-κB/p65 protein into nuclei in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cells, through the increase of expression of IκBα protein [150, 151] .",
