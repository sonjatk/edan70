    "text": "Cloning of ORF2 and Δ35 ORF2 in pSGI has been described earlier [15] . Flag tagged IKKβ [12] , IL-2 receptor α promoter containing NF-κB response element cloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyl ransferase (CAT) coding sequence (NF-κB CAT) [10] , Wildtype, ΔF βTRCP cDNA in pCDNA3.1 [20] and pSGI c-myc [21] constructs were gifts from Drs. Rene Bernards, Ranjan Sen, Richard Benarous and Vijay Kumar, respectively. All DNA constructs used for mammalian cell transfection were purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation [22] . All antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (California, USA); TPA and MG-132 were purchased from Calbiochem Chemicals (California, USA). LPS was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA).",
