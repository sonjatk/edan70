    "text": "Comparative gene expression profiling highlighted that only ATII (CD45-) cells, but not CD45+ lung leukocytes or BAL cells, depict prominent induction of Cxcl1 and-5 mRNA levels. In fact, from the populations covered by our study, the main expression of Cxcl1 and-5 can be allocated to ATII cells, whereas Cxcl2 is predominantly expressed but not CNP-induced by lung and BAL leukocytes (Fig. 6a) . Neither of the macrophage activation markers or pro-inflammatory master cytokines Nos2, Tnf and Il1b showed a conclusive expression profile supporting the inflammatory activation of CD45+ lung or BAL leukocytes ( Fig. 6b and Additional file 1: Figure  S4 ). To identify inflammatory activated cells also in situ, we applied a NF-kB1-GFP reporter mouse strain to visualize cell activation by anti-GFP immunohistochemistry in lung sections and BAL cell cytospin preparations (Additional file 1: Figure S6 ). While no cellular GFP accumulation could be detected in samples from controls or CNP (12 h) exposed mice, strong anti-GFP staining was observed for epithelial cells and macrophages of the LPS positive control (12 h).",
