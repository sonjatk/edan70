    "text": "Many zoonotic viruses antagonize the innate immune response in human cells, and their pathogenic potential often correlates with their abilities to inhibit the innate response in vitro ( [79] [80] [81] [82] for review). Pathogenic hantaviruses inhibit antiviral responses despite high levels of replication, whereas nonpathogenic viruses are efficiently recognized and elicit innate responses that limit replication [83, 84] . This antagonistic capacity must have evolved in the reservoir hosts of these hantaviruses because humans are dead-end hosts. To date, few studies have addressed the interactions between hantaviruses and their rodent hosts in vitro. This is partially due to the unavailability of cell lines, and the reagents and techniques to generate primary cell cultures from the various reservoirs of hantaviruses. The Norway rat/SEOV system is the most tractable for studying virus/reservoir interactions. Inoculation of rat lung-derived endothelial cells with SEOV resulted in virus replication, but little or no induction of cytokines or chemokines, suggesting SEOV can efficiently antagonize antiviral responses [21] . Despite this, endothelial cells increased their expression of the protein PD-L1, which correlated with the ability of these cells to induce Treg cell activity. In addition, antigen presenting cells isolated from Norway rats and infected with SEOV in vitro were resistant to stimulation, suggesting that virus infection inhibits the normal signaling activities of these cells [85] . Thus antagonism of the innate immune response likely allows for viral replication, while at the same time promotes an anti-inflammatory response that limits immunopathology.",
