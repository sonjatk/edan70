    "text": "Zoonotic diseases are caused by infectious pathogens (e.g., virus, bacteria, fungi) that can be naturally transmitted between humans and other vertebrates, including wild and domestic animals. The number of emerging zoonoses and the geographic distribution of previously known zoonotic pathogens have increased in recent decades [15, 16] . More than half of all infectious diseases that affect human populations (60%) result from pathogens that are shared with animals, both wild and domestic, and 75% of emerging zoonotic diseases are attributed to pathogens with origins in wildlife reservoirs [16, 17] . Rapid modification of the environment and human encroachment promotes interactions between humans, domestic animals, and wildlife species, facilitating disease spillover and presenting a challenge to global health and food security in addition to wildlife conservation [18] . These shared drivers of disease emergence and biodiversity loss are increasingly recognized as warranting a coordinated approach to monitor, detect, and mitigate changes in ecological conditions that may result in increased disease risk [19] . The utility of integrated biodiversity monitoring and disease surveillance was recently highlighted by the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity as a pathway to strengthen conservation relevance of One Health policies and research agendas [20] .",
