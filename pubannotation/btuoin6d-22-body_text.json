    "text": "In our study, we described the clinical characteristics of Adv-positive community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent adult patients. The most important findings were that Adv group patients had a longer duration of fever after symptom onset and admission, a higher mean body temperature at admission, a higher number of patients with a body temperature over 39°C Fig. 2 Comparison to the changes in mean body temperature between the Adv-positive and Adv-negative group patients at admission day (a) and within 7 days after admission (b). a Changes in mean temperature in four hours between the Adv and Non-Adv group patients within 24 h at admission (37.6 ± 0.22 vs. 37.1 ± 0.25, P = 0.005), b Comparison of the mean daily temperature between the Adv and Non-Adv group patients for a week (P = 0.156) at admission, a longer duration of the maximal fall in body temperature at admission, and higher rate of no response to antipyretic treatment at admission compared to the Non-Adv group patients. In addition, the instances of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia were greater in the Adv group patients than in the Non-Adv group patients, although in patients who were unresponsive to the initial antibiotics treatment, there was no difference between the two groups. Some epidemiological studies of Adv in South Korea military trainees and personnel have been performed. Yoo et al. [15] reported that adenovirus was identified in 33.0% of all specimens in febrile respiratory illness (FRI) or pneumonia patients. This study was of reviewed military patients with FRI or pneumonia who were tested for respiratory viruses from October 2014 to May 2016. The proportion of patients with pneumonia and the hospitalization rate did not differ between those with and without adenovirus infection. However, adenovirus-infected patients had a significantly higher risk of requiring intensive care or mechanical Table 3 Characteristics of fever and response to antipyretics between Adv, Non-Adv, and unknown pathogen group ventilator support. These notable findings indicate that adenovirus infection has been occasionally associated with mortality and morbidity with loss in combat strength and an increase in the cost of care.",
