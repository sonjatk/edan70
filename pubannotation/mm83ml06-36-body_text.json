    "text": "The K48-linked polyubiquitination of proteins is a pre-requisite for the proteasomal degradation [95] . Although the steady state amounts of Gag were not affected by the addition of DIs, the MHC-I antigen presentation as the final consequence of proteasomal degradation, was significantly enhanced. This finding is in concert with previous studies which show that an enhanced MHC-I antigen presentation did not necessarily correlate with the diminished half-life of Gag [26, 48] . A possible explanation for this observation might be that just a minor fraction of Gag enters the UPS following treatment with DIs and this does not reduce the overall level of Gag that remains non-ubiquitinated. In consistency with this possibility is the notion that only a fraction of de novo synthesized proteins (approx. 5-10%) are entering the DRiP-pathway [96] . Numerous studies show that targeting an antigen for degradation by the 26S proteasome represents a powerful approach to enhance MHC class I antigen presentation and to induce an efficient cytotoxic T-cell (CTL)-response [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] [103] [104] [105] [106] . We now show that also DIs can cause a significantly enhanced MHC class I antigen presentation of Gag-derived epitopes. Thus, it is legitimate to speculate that DIs not only reduce viral replication but might also induce a better CTL recognition of HIV-1 + cells in vivo.",
