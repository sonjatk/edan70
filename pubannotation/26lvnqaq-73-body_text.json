    "text": "The spread of this LPAI virus beyond the respiratory and digestive districts and its high tropism for the infundibulum called for an in-depth analysis of the virus phenotype. Firstly, we evaluated the timing and routes of viral spread to the organs by RRT-PCR analysis of both the cellular and non-cellular fractions of the blood but we could not detect virus RNA. Even though we consider these negative results as the possible consequence of both a suboptimal sensitivity of the molecular techniques applied and the limited sampling times, we should also consider that H9N2 viruses have been rarely detected in the blood of chickens [39, 40] , either in the presence of a S. aureus co-infection [10] or after a combination of an intranasal and intratracheal challenge [41] .",
