    "text": "The immunological relationships between hantaviruses and their rodent reservoir hosts are complex. Infection typically leads to disseminated infection within a few days but without conspicuous signs of disease. Expression of immune genes can be detected in as little as a few days that suggests innate and adaptive immune activation, but the magnitude of expression is substantially less than in hantavirus pathology models. The lack of reagents and methodologies for studying hantavirus reservoirs, most of which are not model organisms, presents a significant challenge. However, new technologies have recently emerged that are cost effective and species-independent, but which generate large amounts of data that require substantial computational and bioinformatics support for data reduction. With these tools, it should be possible to accelerate research to understand the relationships of hantaviruses and their reservoir hosts. work was provided by the Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Pathology, Colorado State University (TS), NIH grant AI054461 (TS), and Intramural Program of NIAID, NIH (JP).",
