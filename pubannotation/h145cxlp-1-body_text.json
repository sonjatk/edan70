    "text": "Before the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic in 2009/ 2010, comparisons of clinical characteristics between patients infected with different influenza types (A vs. B) and between patients infected with different influenza A subtypes showed only small differences when controlling for age [9, 10] . During the pandemic, however, some studies observed increased morbidity and mortality among children compared to previous seasonal influenza [6, [11] [12] [13] , while other studies described the clinical features of A(H1N1)pdm09 as being similar or even milder [14, 15] . Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and fatal viral pneumonia was observed more frequently during the pandemic [16] . Post-pandemic surveillance was recommended, as circulation of A(H1N1)pdm09 was expected to continue for several years, gradually assuming a seasonal influenza pattern [16] .",
