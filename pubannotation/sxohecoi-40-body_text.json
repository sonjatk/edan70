    "text": "Transcytosis assays were conducted using reproductive tractderived (human endometrial carcinoma [HEC-1A]) or intestinal tract-derived (human colonic carcinoma [T84]) cells. HEC1-1A or T84 cell monolayers were created on 0.4 mm polyethylene terephthalate membrane hanging transwell inserts (Millipore). Cell viability was .95% at the time of plating. Electrical resistance across the membrane, which ranged from 400-450 mOhms/cm 2 at the start of the transcytosis assay, confirmed monolayer integrity. Resistance was re-measured after the transcytosis assay in more than 50% of wells and ranged from 450-480 mOhms/ cm 2 . HIV-1 alone or with antibody was added to monolayers in media buffered to pH 6.0 or 7.4. After 12 hours, fluid in the lower chamber (''subnatant fluid''), maintained at pH 7.4, was collected and used to measure viral RNA copy number and infectivity. In the absence of cell monolayers, about 69% of the virus inoculum was present in the lower chamber of the wells after 12 hours. FcRn knockdown of HEC-1A cells HEC-1A cells were transduced with FcRn shRNA Lentiviral Particles (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) following manufacturer's protocol. Cells were selected in medium containing 5 mg/ml Puromycin dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.), and FcRn expression was verified by flow cytometry using rabbit polyclonal anti-FcRn antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), normal rabbit IgG (negative control) and FITC-goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab9)2 secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.) ( Figure S3A ). Cytofix/Cytoperm Plus Kits (BD Biosciences) were used to fix, permeabilize and stain cells. Knockdown of FcRn was also confirmed by western blot using rabbit anti-FcRn antibody (Novus Biologicals) ( Figure S3A ). Wild-type and knockdown cells had similar viability. Neither wildtype nor knockdown HEC-1A cells stained for FccRIIa or FccRIIIa (not shown).",
