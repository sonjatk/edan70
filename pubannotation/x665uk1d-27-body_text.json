    "text": "RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed to confirm virus accumulation in the three 3D8 scFv TG lines after PRV inoculation. Figure 8A shows that PRV gpD RNA was detected in the muscle and brain of WT, STG69, and STG135 mice accompanied by disease symptoms. Immunohistochemical analysis with an anti-gpD antibody supported the viral gene expression data; only WT mice with a high infection rate had Purkinje layer cells from the brain that stained dark brown after diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining ( Figure 8B) .",
