    "text": "Three levels of filtration were compared. The baseline estimates assume that 90% of the outdoor PM 2.5 mass concentration penetrates indoors. In addition, realistic but increasingly challenging penetration levels of 70% and 50% were evaluated. These correspond to effective filtration of PM 2.5 mass concentration by 27% and 45%, respectively, filtration levels that can be achieved in real buildings at least when using mechanical ventilation systems [13] . When discussing the filtration efficiencies of filters and the above mentioned penetration efficiencies, it has to be noted that the -11 -penetration efficiency is defined for the building, accounting for leaks and ventilation from windows, doors etc.",
