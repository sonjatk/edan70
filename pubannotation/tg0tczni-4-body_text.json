    "text": "When molecular sequence data started to be accumulated nearly 20 years ago, it was noted that synonymous codons are not used equally in different genomes, even in different genes of the same genome [1] [2] [3] . As an important evolutionary phenomenon, it is well known that synonymous codon usage bias exists in a wide range of biological systems from prokaryotes to eukaryotes [4, 5] . Codon usage analysis has been applied to prokaryote and eukaryote, such as Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans and human beings [6] [7] [8] . These observed patterns in synonymous codon usage varied among genes within a genome, and among genomes. The codon usage is attributable to the equilibrium between natural selection and mutation pressure [9, 10] . Recent studies of viral codon usage has shown that mutation bias may be a more important factor than natural selection in determining codon usage bias of some viruses, such as Picornaviridae, Pestivirus, plant viruses, and vertebrate DNA viruses [9, [11] [12] [13] . Meanwhile, recent report also showed that the G+C compositional constraint is the main factor that determines the codon usage bias in iridovirus genomes [11, 14] . Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution or individual genes of the viruses.",
