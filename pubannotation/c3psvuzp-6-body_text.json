    "text": "To address whether ADP-ribosylation plays a broad role in viral immunity, we wished to take a comprehensive evolutionary approach to look for evidence of rapid evolution in all of the human PARP genes. We reasoned that evolutionary signatures of recurrent adaptation, such as those previously observed in PARP13, might reveal other uncharacterized PARP proteins that are involved in host-virus interactions. We therefore screened all 17 human PARP genes and their primate orthologs for signatures of recurrent positive selection. Contrary to expectations that most PARP genes are involved in 'housekeeping' functions, we found that nearly one third of human PARP genes bore signatures of recurrent genetic conflicts. In addition to PARP13, our evolutionary screen revealed four other PARP genes that have evolved under very strong positive selection in primates: PARP4, 9, 14 and 15. Two of these genes (PARP14 and 15) have also undergone dramatic gene turnover (gain and loss) during vertebrate evolution, an additional hallmark of gene innovation also seen in innate immunity genes such as APOBEC3 and TRIM5 [38, 39] . Based on their rapid evolution, we hypothesize that these four additional PARP genes are involved in as-yetundescribed host-virus conflicts. Importantly, we anticipate that the identification of these rapidly evolving PARP genes and domains will enable future experiments to elucidate the role ADPribosylation plays in viral replication and host immunity.",
