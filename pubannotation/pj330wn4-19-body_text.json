    "text": "We have developed a plugin for ImageJ that calculates CBF from digital AVI files recorded using high-speed Table 1 The ependymal ciliary beat frequency (CBF) determined by two observers using high-speed digital imaging and the ciliaFA software video microscopy. As opposed to previous studies we validated the software by comparing the results to frequencies obtained using the most accurate method for CBF calculation, directly counting individual ciliary beat cycles during slow-motion playback. Our data showed that the software was validated for use over a wide range of ciliary beat frequencies up to 52 Hz. Table 1 shows that the limits of agreement between the two methods were within the same range as the natural variation that exists between two different observers. Furthermore, the Bland-Altman limits of agreement for human respiratory cilia between the ciliaFA and direct counting methods were very low. Previous software programs validated their results using indirect, less accurate methods, including the early automated photometry method [9] . Previous studies reported limits of agreement ranging from −1.0 to 1.39 Hz [9] , -2.75 to 5.15 Hz [7] and from −3.89 to 3.39 Hz [8] compared to digital high-speed methods. In our system the image capture instrument is not connected to the software, so analysis performed once the experiment is completed. This allows the software to batch process groups of images using the same settings and thus reducing operator input. This study has clearly demonstrated that ciliaFA is reliable system to analyze CBF. In addition to the accurate measurement of ciliary beat frequency the ciliaFA system has a number of advantages. It has high throughput capabilities allowing significant time savings when processing large datasets, it reduces operator error due to selection bias, and it accurately reports static cilia. The latter is a significant advantage as immotile cilia may not be visible to the observer in multilayered cell cultures. Furthermore, by focusing on particular ciliated areas, ciliaFA can report changes and reductions in ciliary beat frequency.",
