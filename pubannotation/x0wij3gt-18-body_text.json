    "text": "Having shown the important role of PDK1 in PGE 2related NSCLC proliferation, we further investigated whether the PGE 2 -mediated up-regulation of PDK1 reflected transactivation of the gene. To this end, we performed transient transcription experiments using human PDK1 promoter-reporter constructs connected to a luciferase reporter gene and found that PGE 2 increased PDK1 promoter activity. The induction of PDK1 promoter activity by PGE 2 was inhibited by c-Jun siRNA (1.319 ± 0.028 vs 1.716 ± 0.069 in BEAS2B, P <0.01; 1.171 ± 0.071 vs 1.468 ± 0.101 in HBEc14-KT, P <0.05) (Fig. 3f ) . Exogenous overexpression of c-Jun enhanced the PDK1 promoter activity (1.753 ± 0.037 vs 1.401 ± 0.075 in BEAS2B, P <0.05; 1.762 ± 0.117 vs (Fig. 3g) . The induction of PDK1 gene promoter activity by PGE 2 was abrogated when the one of c-Jun sites at -4382 bp was mutated in the PDK1 gene promoter, suggesting a critical role for c-Jun in mediating the effect of PGE 2 on PDK1 gene promoter activity (Fig. 3h) . dmPGE 2 increased PDK1 promoter activity (2.432 ± 0.358 vs 1.000 ± 0.039 in BEAS2B, P <0.05); point mutation of c-Jun with ac to tt at −4028 site could not derease PDK1 promoter activity (1.9832 ± 0. vs 1.000 ± 0.024 in BEAS2B, P <0.05); point mutation of c-Jun site with ac to tt at -4382 bp dereased PDK1 promoter activity (1.010 ± 0.011 vs 1.000 ± 0.039 in BEAS2B, P <0.05);",
