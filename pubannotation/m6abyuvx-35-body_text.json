    "text": "For immunohistochemical staining, unfixed frozen liver sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and then incubated with blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the sections were incubated with biotinylated mouse anti-HCV core mono-clonal antibody (5E3) for 2 h at room temperature. After being washed with PBS, the sections were incubated with streptavidin-Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen). The nuclei were stained with 4',6diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Fluorescence was observed using a confocal laser microscope (Laser scanning microscope 510, Carl Zeiss).",
