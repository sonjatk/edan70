    "text": "The quantification was also performed by Proteome Discoverer software 1.3, which can automatically calculate the relative abundance of iTRAQ-labeled peptides as well as the corresponding proteins. Proteins identified with two or more unique peptides were considered as a highly confident identification and used for quantification. Also, to ensure the accuracy of quantification, only the proteins whose coefficient of variation of three biological repeats were less than 20% were identified as DEPs. The protein ratios were calculated from channels (114/113 to 119/113) for all proteins identified in each iTRAQ experiment. Two identical mock samples, with iTRAQ labels of 113 and 114, were used as references. The fold threshold for changed protein fold-change ratios was set at ± 1.20, which covers a 95% quantification area based on the normal distribution of two mock samples (113 versus 114) in all biological replicates 57 . Thus, the proteins with fold-change ratios ≥ 1.20 or ≤ 0.83 were selected as DEPs.",
