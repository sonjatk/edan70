    "text": "This is to our knowledge the largest epidemiological study in almost four decades of childhood CAP in a developing country that identifies several common viruses. We isolated at least one viral pathogen using PCR from 40% of children during the 3-year study period. The literature reveals few studies based on sensitive molecular diagnosis from similar resource-poor settings. Apart from recent studies on hMPV, most previous studies in developing countries have not used PCR for virus detection [1] .",
