    "text": "Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out to analyze the major trend in codon usage pattern in different genomes of polioviruses (excluding non-coding regions). It is a statistical method that performs linear mapping to extract optimal features from an input distribution in the mean squared error sense and can be used by self-organizing neural networks to form unsupervised neural preprocessing modules for classification problems [6] . In order to minimize the effect of amino acid composition on codon usage, each ORF is represented as a 59-dimensional vector. Each dimension corresponds to the RSCU value of one sense codon excluding Met, Trp and three stop codons. Linear regression analysis was used to find the correlation between codon usage bias and gene length. Correlation analysis is used to identify the relationship between codon usage bias and synonymous codon usage pattern. This analysis is implemented based on the Spearman's rank correlation analysis way.",
