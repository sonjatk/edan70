    "text": "Two different types of communication can be differentiated: explicit and implicit. They distinguish between the workload distribution by a parallel component to multiple compute nodes and the communication between two of more servers exchanging data, respectively. Serverserver communication uses raw sockets to transfer data from one machine to the other. This solution provides a performance benefit over more sophisticated alternatives such as RMI or CORBA, but represents the lowest level of abstraction of the underlying network. As an answer to this trade-off, MP 2 overcomes the limitations of development complexity and inflexibility by providing an abstraction at the component level supported by a fixed number of network level operations. Thus, a developer has a high degree of flexibility regarding the operation of a component as long as the implementation adheres to the I/O scheme provided by the communication layer. Implicit communication refers to the communication that takes place between the output of one component and the input of another component, i.e. the selected data paths among components. The underlying transfer mechanism is provided by the middleware and comprises input buffers in order to enable asynchronous communication.",
