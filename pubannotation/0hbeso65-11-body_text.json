    "text": "Reactivation of herpes group viruses may also be one of the factors associated with HCV recurrence after LT. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) are herpes viruses that commonly reactivate after transplantation. They are proposed to have an immunomodulatory effect in transplant recipients and may play a role in promoting HCV replication [27, 28] . Recently, a retrospective study of 347 first LT recipients (donor or recipient CMV seropositive) transplanted for HCV was performed to evaluate the associations of CMV infection and disease with recurrent hepatitis C after LT. It was found that CMV infection was associated with increased risk of fibrosis stage ≧2 and inflammation grade ≧2 [29] . However, their effects on posttransplant HCV recurrence still remain questionable. Data showed that short-term CMV viremia does not enhance the replication of HCV after LT [30] .",
