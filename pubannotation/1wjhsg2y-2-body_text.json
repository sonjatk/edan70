    "text": "Bats are ecologically and taxonomically diverse mammals with over 1300 species distributed globally and serve as a model taxonomic group for ecological and evolutionary research [1] . Yet, population sizes are decreasing (22%) or unknown (57%) for a vast majority of bat species [2] , and there is limited capacity to manage and protect bat populations in much of the world [3, 4] . Bats are increasingly recognized as important reservoirs for zoonotic diseases, and as a result, research effort on bat-associated viruses and other pathogens has grown dramatically in recent years [5, 6] . Bats are reservoir hosts for several notable groups of viruses that pose significant threats to human and livestock health, including filoviruses [7] , paramyxoviruses [8] , and coronaviruses [9] . Given the importance of protecting human health and global economies, disease surveillance has been the focus of a large body of bat research over the past 15 years. While bat conservation and virus surveillance may appear at odds due to conflicting objectives and research priorities [10] [11] [12] [13] , these two endeavors can be complementary and synergistic, especially if properly linked early on through collaborative research networks. Adopting an ecologically-minded One Health approach to proactively identify bat-associated zoonoses and the specific human activities that contribute to increased spillover risk will also contribute to our understanding of the diversity and distribution of bat species in understudied regions. One Health is the concept that the health of humans, animals, and the environment are inextricably linked, and requires multidisciplinary research and collaboration when put into practice [14] . Inclusion of bat experts in initiatives to monitor bat-associated viruses will enhance our ability to derive and communicate meaningful information about potential risks to human and animal health but also inform intervention measures to reduce opportunities for virus spillover in degraded environments.",
