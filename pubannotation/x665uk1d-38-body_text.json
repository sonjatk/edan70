    "text": "A neutral red (NR) cytotoxicity assay was performed to test cell viability after treatment with DNase I or 3D8 scFv. DNase I and 3D8 scFv at concentrations ranging from 1.5625610 23 units to 0.05 units were transferred to HeLa cells using a microporator (iNCYTO). Uptake of neutral red dye into intracellular acidic compartments was determined by measuring absorbance at 540 nm.",
