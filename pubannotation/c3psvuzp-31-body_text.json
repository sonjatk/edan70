    "text": "Tests for positive selection PARP sequences were aligned in Geneious [63] and alignments were edited to remove gaps and ambiguities. Maximum likelihood (ML) tests were performed with codeml in the PAML software suite [40] . Aligned sequences were subjected to ML tests using NS sites models disallowing (M8a) or allowing (M8) positive selection. The p-value reported is the result of a chi-squared test on twice the difference of the likelihood values between the two models using one degree of freedom. All analyses were consistent when performed with varying models of codon frequency (F61 and F364) and varied starting omega values (0.4 and 1.5). Residues with recurrent signatures of positive selection with a posterior probability greater than 0.95 were identified using a Bayes Empirical Bayes (BEB) analysis in PAML and the F364 codon frequency model. A second set of maximum likelihood tests was performed using PARRIS in the HyPhy software suite [41] , which also compares models disallowing or allowing positive selection. We report twice the difference in the log likelihood values (LRT), and a p-value based on that difference. Signatures of episodic positive selection were calculated in two ways. Overall dN/dS ratios for each branch of the phylogenetic tree were calculated using the free ratio model in PAML. A branch-site test (Branchsite REL [42] ) for statistically significant signatures of episodic positive selection was performed using the HyPhy software suite [41] .",
