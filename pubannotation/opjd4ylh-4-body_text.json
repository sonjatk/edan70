    "text": "Nurses play a major role in caring for patients infected with different infectious diseases. Nurses in high TB burden settings are at higher risk of developing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) when compared to the general population, due to their exposure to the large number of smear-positive TB cases managed at hospitals or healthcare facilities [3] . Working in a high-risk TB setting can lead to harrowing experiences for healthcare, especially where health facilities are poorly equipped and managed. Health Care Workers (HCWs), especially nurses, have higher rates of latent and active TB than the general population due to persistent occupational TB exposure, particularly in settings where there is a high prevalence of undiagnosed TB in healthcare facilities and TB infection control programmes are absent or poorly implemented [4] .",
