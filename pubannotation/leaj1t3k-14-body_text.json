    "text": "Many investigators identified potent PPMO activity in cell culture assays and went on to test their antiviral properties in murine experimental models. Most of the investigators explored both the prophylactic and therapeutic potential of PPMO and the best protection was usually achieved with pre-infection and post-infection PPMO treatments. PPMOs were shown to suppress viral replication, attenuate symptoms of disease in and/or increase survivorship of mice infected with WNV [67] , DENV [70] , MHV [63] , PV1 [75] , CVB3 [76] , VEEV [77] , EBOV [64, 78] , RSV [79] , and FLUAV [82, 83] . Some PPMOs demonstrated very profound and impressive antiviral effects. In particular, two 5-μg pre-infection doses of (RX 8 )B-conjugated PMOs completely protected mice against lethal challenge with EBOV [64, 78] . Mice treated with 200-μg doses of a (RXR) 4 XB-conjugated PPMO given pre-and postinfection survived VEEV lethal infection [77] . The authors found that over the 28-day period of monitoring, VEEV was undetectable in PPMO-treated mice brain, blood and peripheral tissues.",
