    "text": "These hypothetical source controls were defined to approach maximum technically feasible reductions. The radon estimate assumes efficient application and control of radon safe construction in radon-prone areas combined with control of second hand smoke exposures known to act synergistically with radon. Efficient second hand smoke reductions have already been demonstrated in Finland in both workplaces and in homes resulting a decrease in proportion of adolescents exposed to SHS from 17% in 1991 to 6% in 2009 [25] and the SHS policies are moving forward also on at European level. The carbon monoxide controls were aimed to be implemented by compulsory alarms that will allow for identification of malfunctioning devices before the risks occur.",
