    "text": "For example our workflow component for ClustalW shows all the options that the original ClustalW program presents to users. The options are presented in a parameter output panel and translated into command line string for calling the underlying ClustalW program upon execution of the workflow. After the completion of ClustalW, an output file is produced on the local hard disk at a specified location containing the aligned data set. This file name and its location is the input for the next component (e.g. Seqboot). The remaining components, e.g. Seqboot with its underlying PHYLIP operate in the same way.",
