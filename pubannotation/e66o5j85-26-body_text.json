    "text": "At least 1 microorganism was detected on nasal swabs in 96.6% of cases and 82.3% of controls (crude OR = 6.4, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 2.1-19.7, P<0.001). Overall, 78.8% of cases and 54.2% of controls were co-infected or co-colonized (crude OR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.8-6.0, P<0.001). Co-detection on nasal swab of S. pneumoniae and RSV was more frequent in cases than in controls (respectively, 15 between cases and controls (respectively, 5.9% [N = 7] vs. 3.1% [N = 3], P = 0.32). A doseresponse relationship was apparent between the number of microorganisms found in nasal swabs and the risk of being a case (Fig 1) . Distribution of S. pneumoniae and RSV differed by season with higher rates of S. pneumoniae in January-June and of RSV in July-September (Fig 2) . Univariate analysis revealed that S. pneumoniae, human metapneumovirus, RSV, and influenza A virus detection in nasal swabs were significantly associated with pneumonia in Mali (Table 3) . Multivariate analysis reinforced linkage of these pathogens with pneumonia, independently of patient age, gender, period per quarter and the presence of other pathogens significantly coupled with increased risk of pneumonia (Table 3) . PAF was the highest for S. pneumoniae (PAF = 46%, 95% CI: 30-59%). Contribution of human metapneumovirus, RSV, and influenza A were lower, with PAFs of 9% (95% CI: 7-11%), 21% (95% CI: 16-25%) and, 8% (95% CI: 6-10%), respectively. Fig 3 reports the distribution of pneumococcal serotypes detected in nasal swabs from cases and controls. The most prevalent serotype in pneumonia cases and controls was serotype 6A/B (18.6% vs. 11.2%, P = 0.13). Serotypes 1 and 5 were more frequent in pneumonia cases than in the controls: 6.8% vs. 0%, P = 0.009, and 4.2% vs. 0%, P = 0.04, respectively.",
