    "text": "Database screening. Data were processed using BioTools software (Bruker Daltonics, Inc.). The files were subsequently submitted to an in-house Mascot server (Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK) for database screening. The data were screened against the human sequence database [National Center for Biotechnology Information non-redundant (NCBInr)]. The search was performed using trypsin as a specific enzyme. A maximum of one missed cleavage was permitted and oxidation (M), iTRAQ 4 plex (K) and iTRAQ 4 plex (N-term) were selected as variable modifications. The data obtained on the micrOTOF-Q were searched with a peptide mass tolerance of 10 ppm and a fragment mass tolerance of 0.8 Da. Protein ratios were normalized using the overall median ratio for all the peptides in the sample for each separate ratio in every individual experiment. The ratio for a given protein was calculated by taking the average of all the peptide ratios that Briefly, the protein lysates were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and subjected to immunoblotting with the following antibodies: Anti-apolipoprotein J precursor antibody (ab16077; dilution, 1:2,000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-hemoglobin β (sc-21757; dilution, 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-CRP precursor (ab32412; dilution, 1:1,000; Abcam), anti-platelet factor 4 precursor (AB1488P; dilution, 1:5,000; Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and anti-VN (ab11591; dilution, 1:500; Abcam) at 4˚C overnight. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Forevergen, Guangzhou, China).",
