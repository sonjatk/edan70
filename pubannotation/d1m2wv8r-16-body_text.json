    "text": "A network focusing on p53 regulation and a pathway involving cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) degradation were enriched according to the Metacore TM database. Using Metacore TM software, 29 DEPs associated with p53 were significantly enriched (p-value = 1.130E-49), including BAK1, VDAC2, HSP60, and Ebp1 (Fig. 5) , indicating that CPV infection may trigger biological processes of p53 regulation.",
