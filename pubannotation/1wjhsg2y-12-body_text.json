    "text": "Focusing on shared threats that lead to both bat population declines and disease emergence will allow for a common research agenda and can serve to bring together bat conservationists and infectious disease experts. While documenting viral diversity and prevalence in reservoir host populations is a critical first step, assessing ecological and environmental factors that may influence host-virus dynamics in bat populations and promote transmission to incidental hosts, such as humans or domestic animals, is vital for developing effective surveillance initiatives. Host-virus dynamics are complex, and the emergence and spread of bat-associated viruses requires more than just the presence of a pathogen in a reservoir host but detailed knowledge of a host species' ecology, behavior, reproduction, genetics, and life history traits [18, 82] . Evidence suggests that many bat-associated viruses have a long history of co-evolution with their bat hosts [83] [84] [85] , further highlighting the importance of understanding both phylogenetic factors and environmental contact with other species to fully appreciate factors driving cross-species transmission [34, 86] . Outbreaks of bat-associated viruses are commonly attributed to atypical interactions between bats and other wildlife species, domestic animals, and humans resulting from human-driven land-use change and encroachment. Shared threats to public health and wildlife conservation transcend national borders, and minimizing such threats will require transboundary collaborations among diverse experts. One multidisciplinary consortium, the Bat One Health Research Network (BOHRN), is now addressing these important issues at a global scale by connecting bat experts and public health researchers to identify critical gaps in research [87] .",
