    "text": "Period The case of Guangzhou based on extended LMDI model economic structure effect (s-effect). The adjustment of industrial structure in Guangzhou was mainly focused on upgrading the traditional advantage industries (i. e. iron and steel, shipbuilding, machinery and equipment, electricity, paper, and textile etc.) and fostering the new and high technology industries (i. e. Software, new material, new energy, and digital industry etc.), announced in the 11 th five-year plan for socioeconomic development in Guangzhou Driving factors of carbon emissions in residential sector in Guangzhou. Driving factors of carbon emissions in residential sector were decomposed yearly first (Table 6 ) and divided into 3 periods (Fig 5) . Although the residential carbon emissions in Guangzhou accounted for a relatively small proportion of the total carbon emissions, it exhibited a rapid growth trend during the whole research period along with the improvement of urbanization level. The total residential carbon emissions increased from 0.55 million tons in 2003 accounting for 3.61% of the total carbon emissions to 2.01 million tons accounting for 6.59% in 2013. Furthermore, the residential carbon emission increments were mainly generated by the urban residents, which increased from 0. The case of Guangzhou based on extended LMDI model was always two times of the average income of rural residents during the same period. The energy intensity effect of urban (e-effect-Urban) played the most important role in curbing carbon emissions growth, resulting in a 0.26 million tons decrease, accounting for 34.87% of the total residential carbon emissions changes in absolute value. During the 12 th five-year plan period (2010-2013), Guangzhou's residential carbon emissions increased by 0.51 million tons. The affluence effect of urban (g-effect-AUI) and the carbon intensity effect of urban (f-effect-Urban) were the most two dominant positive driving factors on the carbon emissions increment, bringing in 0.49 million tons and 0.29 million tons increase, accounting for 95.88% and 57.43% of the total residential carbon emissions changes, respectively.",
