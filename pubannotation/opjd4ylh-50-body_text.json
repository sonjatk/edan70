    "text": "According to the findings of this study it was revealed that nurses feared contracting TB infection. Even though participants were provided with personal protective materials they were of poor quality. Participants seemed to be more concerned about their safety in the wards and they appeared to be more stressed and emotional about the danger that they are exposed to in the wards. A study done by Engelbrecht et al. [23] reveals that nurses consider themselves more vulnerable and at high risk of contracting infection.",
