    "text": "Samples were collected as described in Becker et al. [49] . We sampled sites one to two times annually, capturing one to 17 individuals per site and sampling interval (S1 Table) . To screen for Bartonella by PCR, up to 30 μL blood was stored on Whatman FTA cards at room temperature. To assess the presence of Bartonella in saliva and feces, we collected oral and rectal swabs from vampire bats in Peru. Swabs were preserved in 2 mL RNAlater (Invitrogen) at -80˚C until laboratory analyses. For Peru sites sampled in 2016, we also recorded the number of bat flies per vampire bat [32] .",
