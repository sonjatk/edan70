    "text": "In order to investigate of whether DUB activities play any role in late steps of HIV-1 replication, we analyzed VLP release and Gag processing after DI treatment. For this purpose HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the HIV-1 expression plasmid pNLenv1 [43] which directs efficient expression of all HIV-1 proteins except the Env glycoproteins. Cells were treated with the following DIs: P22077, which specifically inhibits the DUBs USP7 and USP47 [59] , the DI P5091, which only inhibits USP7 [60] , and the DI PR-619, that, in addition to USP7 and USP47, inhibits the DUBs Josephin domain containing 2 (JOSD2), deneddylase 1 (DEN1), UCH-L3, UCH-L5, USP2, 4, 5, 8, 15, 20, and 28 [59] . Western blot analyses of whole cell lysates and VLP fractions, using Gag-specific antibodies, revealed that treatment with P22077 or PR-619 led to an overall defect in Gag processing with prominent accumulation of the Pr55 Gag precursor protein as well as the processing intermediates p25 (CA-SP1), p41 (MA-CA-NC) and p39 (MA-CA) in the VLP fractions ( Figure 1A ). In contrast, addition of the DI P5091, which is selective for USP7, had no influence on Gag processing ( Figure 1B ). Densitometric analyses of the western blot data illustrate that the efficacy of Gag processing was reduced by about 2-fold in cells treated with P22077 or PR-619, whereas cells treated with the DI P5091 had wt level ( Figure 1C ), indicating that certain DUB activities regulate late steps of HIV replication. Although the DI P22077 and PR-619 clearly reduced Gag processing, none of the inhibitors had any influence on the efficiency of VLP release ( Figure 1D ).",
