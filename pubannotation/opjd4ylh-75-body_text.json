    "text": "Our biggest concern is that the TB wards are perpetuating the spread of infection. The management promised us that they will build new TB wards that are well ventilated, that have good airflow, fans and regularly serviced UV lights as well as big windows and patients' waiting area to allow airflow. The wards will have nursing station and there will be a demarcation between TB, MDR-TB and XDR-TB. We really need those wards because we are not safe here.\"",
