    "text": "The findings of this study revealed that patients continued to default treatment for different reasons, such as experiencing side effects, alcohol abuse, cultural and religious beliefs, and lack of access to healthcare facilities. Some default because they wanted to continue receiving the TB grant. The findings of this study concur with those of a study that was done by Herrero et al. [17] , which listed the barriers contributing to poor TB treatment compliance, such as communication difficulties, low literacy level, inadequate knowledge and low awareness of TB disease, patients' attitudes and beliefs in treatment efficacy, depression and other psychiatric illness, alcohol and substance abuse, unstable living conditions, negative health provider attitudes, stigma and discrimination, overcrowding, and access to medicine.",
