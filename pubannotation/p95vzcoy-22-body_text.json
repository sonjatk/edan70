    "text": "The experimental data show that foodborne transmission, e.g., via consumption of infected honeybees, can be an underlying mechanism, which enables DWV to infect M. rubra and potentially other arthropod predators and scavengers [29] [30] [31] [32] 37] . Indeed, both treatment groups that were fed with virus-infected honeybee pupae had consistently higher viral titers than the controls. Since symptomatic honeybees with an overt infection have 10 10+ genomic equivalents of DWV and at lower infection levels 10 3 -10 9 genomic copies [67] , the titers observed in M. rubra seem to reflect covert infections. However, the average honeybee worker (~120 mg) weights about 60 times more than a M. rubra worker [68, 69] . When controlled for these bodyweight differences, the DWV A and B titers found in the treatment groups therefore almost reach infection levels per mg ant-tissue analogous to an overt infection in bees. Further, the viral titers were very low in the control colonies, thereby indicating that DWV A and B were only replicating in the treatments. Interestingly, the ratios of DWV type-B to type-A were very similar in the ants, regardless of the treatment (4.17/1 (T1), 5.46/1 (T2), as well as in the injected honeybee pupae (5.88/1 for DWV-B to DWV-A), thereby suggesting that both strains had similar reproductive capacities in both hosts.",
