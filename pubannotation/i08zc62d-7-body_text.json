    "text": "The DNA template for C. perfringens sialidase (Cp-NanI) has NCBI reference sequence WP_011590331.1. For bacterial expression, the NanI catalytic domain without the lectin domain (NanI CD ; residues 243-694) was amplified from C. perfringens genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of the pET-23d expression vector (Novagen), which contains a direct C-terminal hexahistidine (His 6 ) tag. Cp-NanI CD protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3) cells. The transformed cells were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 mg ml À1 ampicillin at 310 K. The bacterial cells were induced at 293 K for 20 h with 0.5 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Pharmacia) at an OD 600 of 0.6 and then harvested by centrifugation at 4000g for 20 min. The harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 1 mM PMSF, 2 mM -mercaptoethanol) and lysed by sonication, after which the lysate was centrifuged at 14 000g for 1 h. The resultant supernatant was applied to an immobilized metal-affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Peptron) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole). The column was then washed with ten bed volumes of wash buffer. The His 6 -tag fused protein bound to the column was eluted with elution buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole). The samples were then purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare Life Science) preequilibrated with gel-filtration buffer (25 mM CHES-HCl pH 9.5, 200 mM NaCl), after which the fractions containing Cp-NanI CD protein were collected. The protein was concentrated to 21.8 mg ml À1 using an Amicon Ultra-15 30K (Millipore) and was stored at 193 K.",
