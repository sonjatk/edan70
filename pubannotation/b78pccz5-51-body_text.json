    "text": "Because the aim of this study is to estimate how changes in ventilation affect exposures, the probability distributions of national ventilation rates in a building stock of year 2010 had to be estimated. Surprisingly limited data of measured ventilation rates are available for European countries. Due to this, available measured data was reviewed and a regression model was created combining the climatological and economical differences in the building stocks with ventilation rates. Further modelling with a Bayesian subjective probability approach was used for generation of lognormal probability distributions for ventilation rates in each EU-26 country ( Table 1 , method described in detailed elsewhere [17] ).
