    "text": "Astrocytic cultures. Mouse primary astrocytes were isolated from primary mixed glial-cell cultures of newborn ICR mice, as described previously 82, 83 . The purity of the astrocytes was >95%, as determined by immunostaining with the anti-GFAP antibody. Astrocytes were plated at a density of 3 × 10 5 cells/well in 6-well dishes. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mg/ml bovine insulin, and 0.2% glucose. To assess the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, confluent astrocytes were treated with 1 μg/ml LPS and/or HM. H 2 treatment was performed by replacing the astroglial medium with HM, and dehydrogenated HM was used as a control medium. The time course of H 2 concentration in HM was described previously 12 . Replacement of the astroglial medium with HM or control medium was performed 3 h before the addition of LPS.",
