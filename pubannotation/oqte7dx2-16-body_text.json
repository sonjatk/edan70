    "text": "WDR proteins and USP46 are conserved across phylogeny from yeast to humans (Table 1) . Studies in the multicellular filamentous fungi Aspergillus nidulans were the first to describe a role for WDR proteins in regulating DUBs Kelly, 2001, 2002) . CreB, which is homologous to USP46 and USP12, and CreC, which is homologous to WDR20, were identified in a screen for genes involved in carbon catabolite repression and gene expression. Genetic experiments revealed that CreC acts upstream of CreB and that CreC stabilizes CreB by interacting with and preventing proteolysis of the DUB (Lockington and Kelly, 2002) .",
