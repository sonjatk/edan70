    "text": "To further investigate the role of CxCul4, Hsu cells were transfected with a plasmid containing CxCul4 cloned under insect promoter (OpIE2), infected with WNV at 24 h post-transfection, and total RNA and supernatant media were collected at 48 hpi. Real-time RT-qPCR showed increased WNV NS1 levels (>4-fold) in cells transfected with CxCul4 compared with empty vector (Control), indicating increased viral replication (Fig 3E) . Plaque assays conducted on supernatant media also showed significantly increased viral titer (> 10-fold) in cells over-expressing CxCul4 compared with control cells (Fig 3F) . In a parallel experiment, western blots using V5 antibody was performed on total cell lysates collected from Hsu cells transfected with CxCul4 to confirm exogenous expression level of CxCul4 ( Fig 3G) . Combined, the above data suggest that CxCul4 plays a significant pro-viral role during WNV infection.",
