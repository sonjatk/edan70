    "text": "The most common clinical signs reported in FeL include skin or mucocutaneous lesions and lymph node enlargement, and they have been described in more than half of the cases (Table 4 ). Some cats showed only dermatological lesions alone [13, 52, 56, 58] , while others with skin lesions showed a combination with systemic signs [12, 14, 21, 26, 36, 51, 60, [62] [63] [64] 68] . Conversely, other cats did not have any skin detectable lesions on clinical presentation [11, 36, 50, 54, 55, 57, 66, 69, 70] .",
