    "text": "As the founding organization of WAB-Net, EHA aims to serve as a \"bridging actor\" within the network, leveraging its connections with scientists and other stakeholders in the region and globally to link various actors and accelerate the transfer of knowledge between them, as per Kingston et al. [21] . By adopting the approach that \"local problems require local solutions,\" WAB-Net will empower local scientists to take ownership of field and laboratory research activities and help shape the overall direction of research based on locally identified priorities [21, 151] . The central goals of WAB-Net are to provide support to existing organizations and scientists, strengthen scientific capacity building, and bring together groups in a strategic fashion, so as to ensure maximum effectiveness and resiliency of the network. While EHA is helping to initiate the network, ownership of the research network must ultimately be driven by the partner scientists and stakeholders from the region. In order to achieve long-term sustainability, WAB-Net will incorporate the following elements into its design: (1) in-service training programs, (2) data sharing platforms, (3) communication and networking opportunities, and (4) local leadership. We detail each of these elements of sustainability further below.",
