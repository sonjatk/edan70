    "text": "A disadvantage of IPknot over Iterative HFold is that being an MEA-based method, IPknot does not produce free energy of the predicted structure. Also to get the best prediction, the user needs to provide some guidance as to what type of structure to predict for the given sequence, e.g., whether pseudoknot-free or pseudoknotted.",
