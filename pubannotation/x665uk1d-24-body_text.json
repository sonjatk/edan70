    "text": "On the basis of the expression levels in the F 0 69 line, the F 0 90 line produced 12.25 times more 3D8 scFv in the liver and the F 0 110 and F 0 135 lines showed 0.29 and 0.07 times less than that of the F 0 69 line. However, the F 0 90 and F 0 135 lines had 3,270 and 3,174 times more 3D8 scFv in the brain than that of the F 0 69 line, even 201.98 times more in F 0 110. Therefore, the F 0 69 line was used as a control and the F 0 90 and F 0 135 lines were used for testing the antiviral preventive effects in TG mice lines after PRV infection ( Figure 7A) .",
