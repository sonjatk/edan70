    "text": "To encourage other wildlife disease surveillance studies to develop qPCR assays with the potential to detect multiple pathogens along with an IC to assess qPCR quality, we describe the development of two qPCR assays that are capable of detecting both SQPVand SADV in a sample from either red or grey squirrels. These assays thus present substantial improvements on current methods to detect these agents and will facilitate our understanding of the epidemiology of squirrel pathogens.",
